E51,E512,ECAT,GCAT,GDIP	 The U.N.'s Iraq Sanctions Committee on Monday approved procedures to deliver humanitarian aid to Iraqis on a prioritised need basis, pushing acceptance of food and medicine supply contracts ahead of less vital commodities. The change was requested by Iraq in February, leading committee technical experts to meet on Friday where agreements were reached to alter existing practices. Today's committeee action approves those technical changes, but more work must be done to untangle financial questions before the prioritised process is implemented, according to the sanctions chairman, Portugal's Ambassador Antonio Monteiro. Iraq is allowed to import food and aid as part of a humanitarian exception to six-year-old sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990. For a six-month period Iraq is permitted to sell $2 billion worth of crude oil, receipts are then to be used for buying aid, reparation payments and other expenses. Even though the deal has been in place since December 10, and more than 100 million barrels of oil sold, food and medicine have yet to reach Iraqi civilians.   First shipments of food, however, did reach Iraq last week, but have yet to funnel through the distribution process. Monteiro said he hoped the new prioritised procedures would be finalised by U.N. departments this week. Until now, humanitarian goods have been processed on a first-come-first served basis, leading to an abundance of aid contract approvals for non-food items, like bath soap, tea and detergent. Iraq wants to distribute a variety of goods to ensure compatibility with its existing rationing system, filling a so-called &quot;food basket&quot; of items. Monteiro said the U.N.'s Department of Humanitarian Affairs was working on the prioritised food list, while the World Health Organisation was performing the same task for medicinal needs. &quot;We approved a list of priorities that will come out, I hope, this week,&quot; Monteiro said. Financial details must also be worked out to speed aid delivery, Monteiro said, noting the committee wants to utilize available money to approve more aid contracts. &quot;We would like to immediately use the money that comes from sales of oil after getting the letter of credit on these sales,&quot; Monteiro said.   Currently, oil sales receipts must be in a special escrow account before aid contracts can be paid for, and approved. Monteiro said 359 goods application contracts have been received by the U.N. Of that total, 82 have reached the sanctions committee, with 57 gaining approval. Of the remaining contracts before the panel, 12 have been processed and are awaiting approval under a no-objection procedure, and 13 were on-hold for various reasons. Monteiro said 40 oil contracts have been approved thus far, with approved contract volumes of 112 million barrels. No oil contracts were pending approval, according to Monteiro. On a related note, Monteiro said the Russian representative at the sanctions meeting reiterated statements from Moscow earlier on Monday, denying a deal to develop oil reserves in Iraq violated U.N. sanctions. &quot;The deal will only be applied after the regime's sanctions are removed,&quot; Monteiro said, paraphrasing the statement from the Russian delegate.
C15,C152,C18,C181,CCAT	 Shares of insurance company Security-Connecticut Corp rose 8-1/8 at 45-5/8 after it signed a definitive merger agreement with ReliaStar Financial Corp that values Security-Connectict at $47 a share. &quot;I think it's a good deal. Security-Connecticut...was not getting any recognition in the market for what they were doing and the potential there,&quot; Nutmeg Securities analyst Ira Zuckerman said. Dain Bosworth analyst J. Chris Sergeant said he considers ReliaStar's $488 million offer for Security-Connecticut to be &quot;reasonable.&quot;   ReliaStar shares were down 1/8 at 59-1/8. &quot;The stock has done very well already,&quot; Sergeant added. &quot;It was at its all-time high and fully valued in the near-term.&quot; ReliaStar's 52-week high is $50 a share. The company said the deal will be neutral to earnings in 1997 and modestly additive in 1998. ((Reuters Chicago Newsdesk (312) 408-8787))

C13,CCAT,GCAT,GHEA	 New Jersey breast cancer patients would be assured that their health insurance would pay for at least two days in the hospital for surgery under legislation enacted by the Legislature Monday. The bill, sent to Gov. Christie Whitman, called for at least 72 hours after a modified radical mastectomy and 48 hours of hospital care for a simple mastectomy. The bill passed the state Senate Monday by a 37-0 vote. Gov. Whitman two years ago signed a bill requiring insurors to cover a two-day minimum hospital stay for mothers after giving birth.
C13,CCAT,M11,MCAT	 China's two stock exchanges on Friday ordered brokerages to make public to retail investors the top stock gainers and losers and the names of the firms most actively involved in trading them, exchange announcments said.   The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges in similar announcements said they would transfer information to brokerages about the five top gaining and losing stocks in each trading day which move more than seven percent in either direction. The brokerages must make the information public in their business halls through notices or on large electronic boards so that ordinary investors have access to the information, the announcements said. The exchange will also make available to the brokerages the names of institutions most actively involved in trading the top stocks. Brokerages must pass them to the retail investors in the same way, they said. The announcements said the date for the implemention of the new rule had yet to be settled and would be announced later. The exchanges on Friday also set daily movement limits for all shares and investment fund units at 10 percent in either direction with effect from next Monday. Brokers said the measures were taken after dramatic rises and falls in prices of securities on the exchanges in recent months.
C11,C13,CCAT,E12,ECAT,M13,M132,MCAT	 Major banks from Japan, the United States and Europe plan to team up to form a new financial institution capable of real-time currency settlements, bank officials said on Tuesday. The new institution would handle settlements for currency trade in eight core currencies in real-time, hoping in this way to reduce settlement risk, they said. Currently, banks are exposed to large amounts of cross-border currency settlement risks because delivery of foreign exchange transactions is made in different time zones.   There is also a risk in foreign currency settlements that after one bank has delivered one side of the transaction, its counterparty may go bankrupt and fail to deliver the offsetting currency. The new bank, scheduled to be established in 1999, would allow payments of both sides of the transactions, say in both dollars and yen, at the same time, the sources said. To minimise the impact of potential business failures among international financial institutions, the member banks would be authorised to issue collateral in return for a leadership role in currency settlement business, they added.   But central banks would reserve the right to intervene directly in serious cases of financial failure, they said. Twenty banks are currently likely to take part, including Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and Fuji Bank of Japan, Citibank and J.P. Morgan of the United States, and Britain's National Westminster Bank. The currencies handled are likely to include the U.S. dollar, the Canadian dollar, the yen, the mark, the pound, the French franc, the Swiss franc and the Dutch guilder, the sources said. A number of details remain to be worked out, including the location of the new bank and how many banks will ultimately take part. The new institution's stance towards to a single European currency, to debut in 1999, also remains to be decided, the sources said. --Tokyo Treasury Desk +813-3432-8806
C31,CCAT	 Tractebel SA made its first trade in the U.S. power market last month, becoming the first European utility in the market, chief executive Baron Philippe Bodson told a news conference. The company's new trading subsidiary, Tractebel Energy Marketing Inc, officially began operation April 1, a full week after its first electricity trade, according to the new unit's trading chief, William L. Coorsh. Tractabel is &quot;the first continental utility to be involved in U.S. energy marketing,&quot; Baron Bodson said.   As a result, the company expects to &quot;be very well positioned&quot; when power trading starts in Europe, he said. He does not expect natural gas trading in Europe, stating &quot;the dream of competition in Europe is the dream of the European commission&quot; because of the limited number of suppliers. Trading volume for the recently initiated natural gas futures contract on London's International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) has been thin. With four natural gas suppliers, Baron Badson explained, &quot;one can corner the market.&quot;   Tractabel chose to start a trading firm from scratch instead of acquiring an existing firm &quot;because it is a lot cheaper,&quot; explained Wim Heyselberghs, senior vice president of distribution operations for Tractebel Electricity and Gas International. He said the new firm will market and trade electricity, natural gas and fuel oil at both the wholesale and retail levels &quot;mainly in the U.S. Northeast and eastern Canada.&quot; That's where another Tractabell subsidiary, CRSS Inc, has most of its non-utility power plants, he noted. By year end, Heyselberghs said, Tractebel Energy Marketing will have 20 employees in offices in Houston, Boston and Montreal. The new units' objective is &quot;not maximum volume,&quot; he said, but to be the &quot;most profitable&quot; trader. Tractebel officials declined to discuss the company's profit and volume goals.
