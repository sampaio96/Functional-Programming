M14,M143,MCAT	 IPE Brent futures ended sharply lower on Tuesday as they tracked stiff losses by the NYMEX energy complex, traders said. July Brent settled 78 cents lower at $19.22 a barrel while June gas oil closed earlier some $5.75 lower at $172.00 a tonne. Traders said hefty losses by NYMEX futures had pressured IPE Brent lower. The July contract had traded around the $19.70 level for most the session prior to NYMEX's open. &quot;A lot of people were saying it would go lower but they weren't prepared to do so without NYMEX,&quot; said one trader. Traders attributed NYMEX crude's falls to technical weakness as well as an increasingly lacklustre gasoline season. On the technical front, traders said a break below $21.50 and $21.30 a barrel provoked a sell-off of the NYMEX July contract by a number of funds &quot;I don't think many of the funds were comfortable below $21.50,&quot; one trader said. July NYMEX crude was trading 87 cents off at $20.76 a barrel at 1941 GMT, while June heating oil was 2.22 cents lower at 55.30 cents a gallon and gasoline was 1.57 cents lower at 65.35 cents a gallon. A lacklustre performance by gasoline at a time when it should be booming was also seen as weighing on the market. The Memorial Day holiday traditionally marks the shift of the U.S. gasoline season into top gear and the start of bumper prices for producers, but so far the scamble for material seen last year has failed to materialise. IPE Traders said that news earlier on in the session that Shell had cut crude runs by roughly 14 percent at its Pernis refinery due to poor margins had also put a dampener on Brent futures. Shell's move comes in the footsteps of run cuts by BP and Texaco at their joint Nerefco refinery in Rotterdam last week. -- London Newsroom, +44 171 542 7714.

C42,CCAT,E41,ECAT,GCAT,GJOB	 Coal &amp; Allied Industries Ltd said on Friday it was disappointed employees at its Hunter Valley Number One mine had voted to continue a two-week old strike. The mine's general manager Allan Davies said he understood the strike would last until at least July 8 or July 9. &quot;I am amazed they are staying out in a crazy campaign that may ultimately result in the loss of jobs,&quot; he told Reuters. Coal &amp; Allied, 71 percent owned by Rio Tinto Plc/Ltd, has estimated each strike day costs the company about A$1 million in lost revenue.   Davies said mine management was considering using alternative labour to move coal from the mine to port to ensure it satisfied its contractual requirements. Volunteers from non-striking staff were already mining coal and the company hoped to start washing and loading coal in the future, he said. &quot;We wouldn't be looking to move huge amounts initially, but obviously for the viability of the business we need to start doing it,&quot; he said. The strike revolves around Coal &amp; Allied's attempts to introduce individual contracts to all 550 staff at the mine.   Rio Tinto recently branded its New South Wales coal operations as &quot;atrocious&quot; and outlined a 12-month campaign to turn around operations. The open cut mine's main customers are Japanese and East Asian power utilities. It normally produce 7.5 million tonnes of coal a year and has a capital value of A$430 million. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
E13,E131,ECAT,GCAT,GPOL	 One coveted prize has kept British policymakers awake at night for the past three decades -- low inflation which lasts. But the Conservative party under John Major on Thursday can lay convincing claim to that elusive trophy, with core inflation at 2.7 percent in March, a whisker above the 2.5 percent target set for the end of the current parliament. &quot;Macro-economic policy since the 1992 election has operated very well. The anti-inflation framework looks sturdy and the current government's record on fighting inflation is above average,&quot; said Adrian Cooper, of the influential Oxford Economics forecasting team. Britain has been aiming to achieve low inflation which can survive economic cycles since the 1960s, but external shocks and policy mistakes litter the country's economic history. Not only have Conservatives adopted a tough inflation target, they have also developed a framework for a more transparent monetary policy making process and put low inflation at the heart of economic policy making. The results have been encouraging, not least for the Bank of England which has been urging policy-makers to keep their eyes trained on the anti-inflation ball and not trade rising prices for short-term spurts in economic growth. &quot;The results over the past few years have, I would say, been encouraging, although it is still early days,&quot; Bank of England governor Eddie George said in a speech on Wedneday. But there is still work to do to meet the Bank's exacting standards, and the government's self-imposed target of 2.5 percent for underlying inflation. &quot;Inflation over the past four years has...averaged about 2.75 percent which is not as low as it needs to be if we really are to squeeze inflationary expectations out of the system,&quot; George said. If the government's inflation performance over the past four years is good, that compares with a decidedly shaky track record before that. Economists said the ruling Conservative party has made huge mistakes in their battle against inflation during their unbroken 18 year reign in office, and past policy failures still haunt them ahead of the May 1 election. Maybe voters have long memories -- the opposition Labour Party leads the Tories by nearly 20 points in the polls with election day only two weeks away. &quot;The Conservative's record over the past 18 years is very chequered. They let the 1980s spending boom run out of control, and then followed that with membership of Europe's exchange rate mechanism (ERM) which proved a complete debacle,&quot; said Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London. The late-'80s boom, which the government let spiral out of control, was extremely damaging. Interest rates were forced up to 15 percent and the economy dived into a tailspin which pushed unemployment towards three million in 1992. &quot;The then Chancellor Nigel Lawson was mesmerised by the exchange rate and set policy accordingly, and ignored the inflation warning signals coming from the domestic economy,&quot; said Richard Jeffrey, economist at Charterhouse in London. Membership of the ERM currency grid was undertaken in an effort to tame inflation which was running into double-figures, but the UK joined at too high an exchange rate and was then forced into an embarrassing exit by financial markets. It was in defending the pound against the might of the curreny markets that the government briefly pushed base rates up to 15 percent. Economists said people, and houseowners in particularly, will not forget that in a hurry. But economists are inclined to give Prime Minister John Major a good end-of-term report, at least as an inflation-fighter, since the pound's ignominious ERM exit in September 1992. Take the figures. The all-items inflation rate averaged 3.7 percent in 1992, 1.6 percent in 1993, 2.4 percent in 1994, 3.5 percent in 1994, and 2.4 percent last year. For March 1997 it came in at 2.6 percent. Britain's European partners have routinely recorded such low inflation figures, but for Britain it marks a revolution as low inflation has become the central objective of economic policy and the public warms to low inflation goals. In the 1970s, by contrast, inflation in Britain soared to 25 percent, chiefly due to the shock of soaring oil prices. Even in the 1980s under former premier Margaret Thatcher the culture of inflation survived, with rising real incomes and soaring house prices widely popular with the electorate. Only recently has the spell of the inflation culture been broken in Britain, economists said. And Major's Conservatives can take much of the credit for that. &quot;The aims of low inflation have become widely accepted and institutionalised under the Conservatives. The Conservatives may lose the election but their mainstream economic policies will win out as the Labour party have endorsed their anti-inflation aims,&quot; said economist Lyons of DKB. The Labour Party has adopted the mantle of inflation hawks, remodelling its economic policy goals after losing the past four elections, and embracing a more free-market approach to economic management, including selective privatisation. It has also set an inflation target of 2.5 percent or less. Some fear, however, that British monetary policy has again been left too loose ahead of the May 1 election, and the current lively economy could lead to fresh inflation headaches. &quot;Base lending rates should be 7.0 not 6.0 percent to tackle inflation, and inflation minus mortgage costs will rise towards 4.0 percent by the end of this year, well above the target,&quot; said economist Jeffrey. But not all agree. &quot;Not for the first time people in the markets and the media are getting scared about inflation quite out of proportion to the situation on the ground,&quot; HSBC Group chief economist Roger Bootle, a member of the British Treasury's panel of independent forecasters, said. Bootle forecasts underlying inflation at 2.25 percent by year-end. He said people were underestimating the effects of a strong pound and also of competition among British retailers.
E12,E51,E513,ECAT,G15,G151,G154,GCAT	 German Finance Minister Theo Waigel on Saturday defended his scheme to revalue the Bundesbank's gold and foreign exchange reserves as a justified measure which would help Bonn to qualify for Europe's single currency. Revaluing the reserves was an &quot;absolutely legitimate and economically clean&quot; move, he told Der Spiegel in an interview released before the magazine hits news stands on Monday. &quot;That will have a positive impact on meeting the Maastricht criteria as a condition for taking part in European monetary union (EMU),&quot; Waigel said. By marking gold and forex reserves -- booked by the Bundesbank at historic lows -- up to market values Bonn wants to make it easier to cut national debt and trim the budget deficit to help it qualify this year for EMU. But the idea has outraged Germany's European partners and led to cries of &quot;fudge&quot; and creative accounting. A senior European Union official on Friday said it was unlikely Bonn could use the revaluation to cut Germany's deficit. In separate remarks which appeared to contradict what he told Spiegel, Waigel said on Saturday Bonn would fulfil the Maastricht criteria without recourse to the revaluation. &quot;We are in a position, independent of the question of revaluing the gold reserves, to meet the Maastricht criteria,&quot; he told reporters after meeting his counterparts from Austria and Switzerland in the southern town of Regensburg. The revaluation would in theory create a windfall profit for the Bundesbank which under a 1993 law would have to be transferred into a fund created to pay down debts arising from German unification in 1990. &quot;Something which has been created as a people's asset, as a legacy, will be used to pay off an inherited burden,&quot; Waigel told Spiegel. He reiterated that the revaluation would not lead to the sale of Germany's gold reserves. He also said in Regensburg that his proposed scheme would not create the danger of a rise in money supply or inflation. &quot;We will not sell a single ounce of the gold reserves, but rather fix their worth higher. That is completely normal,&quot; Waigel told Spiegel. At current prices the Bundesbank's gold and currency hoard would be worth around 70 billion marks more than the 86 billion marks it is valued at under the existing accounting method. Waigel said the revaluation would have had to be carried out anyway in time for the Bundesbank to transfer a portion of its reserves to the future European Central Bank to back the euro. &quot;It makes sense to treat all gold and foreign exchange reserves in the same way,&quot; he said. Waigel also said he could not rule out possible tax hikes to meet the Maastricht treaty's budget deficit target of three percent of gross domestic product this year to qualify for the planned start of EMU in 1999. He said that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government did not face the risk of breaking up over the refusal by junior partners the Free Democrats (FDP) to accept tax hikes. &quot;We must exhaust all options to avoid tax increases,&quot; Waigel said. &quot;But a finance minister who ruled that out now would be irresponsible.&quot;
E21,E211,ECAT,GCAT,GPOL	 The Brazilian Lower House Wednesday approved a bill overhauling the corporate tax system, officials said. One element of the new bill, which takes effect in 1997, is the elimination of the so-called transfer price, a measure which has allowed multinationals to pay less tax by underreporting exports and overvaluing imports by their Brazilian subsidiaries.   Lower House officials said deputies would vote on amendments to the bill separately. The law, which must still be passed by the Senate, allows for deductions for poor-performing loans, charges tax on &quot;real&quot; profits and not assumed profits, and changes the schedule for corporate tax payments to quarterly from monthly. Voting on the bill had been held up from Tuesday and resumed Wednesday after the government agreed to withdraw a provision that would have raised taxes on cheque factoring companies and another that would have eliminated meal tickets.   The government also agreed to tone down powers given to the Internal Revenue Service to punish tax dodgers. The government presented the bill to Congress after progress on a wider-ranging tax reform package became bogged down in a special lower house committee. -- Michael Christie, Brasilia newsroom 55-61-2230358

M11,M13,M132,MCAT	 German stocks closed at a record high on Wednesday but other European bourses were in the doldrums, dogged by worries over interest rates. On currency markets, the dollar strengthened as traders took an optimistic view of the outcome of a policy-making meeting of the U.S. central bank taking place on Wednesday. In Frankfurt, floor trading extended its record-breaking rally and closed at a new peak, boosted by the strengthening dollar, which was seen as helping exports. The DAX index of 30 leading shares reached an all-time trading high and then closed up 39.13 points at 2,773.43, eclipsing the record set only last Friday. Floor trading in Frankfurt ends at lunchtime. Computerised deals measured by the IBIS index broke the intra-day record set on Tuesday, climbing to 2778.83 points, a gain of 0.4 percent, as the dollar climbed decisively over the psychologically-important 1.50-mark level. &quot;The lights are all on green,&quot; said one trader as screen-based deals continued to climb despite a poor start in Wall Street when the Producer Price Index came in stronger than expected, stoking inflation worries. Frankfurt bourse dealings, particularly in export-oriented chemicals and car shares, had been held back by the weak dollar, which had been trading at a two-month low near 1.49 marks. The dollar got another boost after the Tuesday IBIS close on comments by Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer that the dollar was once again on its way higher and that he always welcomed the dollar being at its correct level. German investors, already encouraged by the dollar's strength after supportive comments by German central bank officials, were further cheered when utility giant Veba reported a surprise 25 percent hike in nine-month net profits. The news drove Veba shares up to a record 86.90 marks, spreading the mood of optimism. But some analysts saw the momentum slackening. &quot;The rally is feeding the rally, but today with somewhat less foaming at the mouth,&quot; said one dealer. In London, Europe's biggest bourse, stocks edged lower as investors, already depressed by worries over interest rates, digested the impact of the Producer Price Index. The Dow Industrials fell 0.24 percent on the figures. Investors were also focusing attention on the rate-setting U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting that began at 1400 GMT. Most analysts expected the Fed would hold rates steady amid signs that the see-saw U.S. economy was settling down and this would be greeted with relief by global equity markets. New York's recent bull run was rooted in this view. A steeper-than-anticipated decline in British unemployment and unexpectedly strong unit wage costs revived concerns about inflationary pressures, further depressing markets. &quot;It does seem the labour market is pretty buoyant...The data underlines the overall recovery is becoming quite punchy,&quot; said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell economist Ciaran Barr. &quot;Interest rates are going to go up early next year, the pressure is on for a 25 point rise before the election. It does make the case for a rate rise that much clearer.&quot; In Paris, stocks slipped 0.6 percent despite hitting a year's year high on Tuesday. A large state sale of shares in Elf adding to consolidation pressures. On currency markets, the dollar strengthened against the mark and the yen, buoyed up by traders' optimism over the FOMC meeting. &quot;You almost have this Goldilocks scenario in the U.S. with solid sustainable growth and no inflation. Certainly in the near term I don't see that threatened,&quot; said Stuart Weatherby, economist at Panmure Gordon. Analysts said the U.S. currency was also supported by comments on Tuesday from Bundesbank officials, including Tietmeyer, supporting a firmer dollar. &quot;German industrial production figures have been weaker than expected. In light of that, the Buba is not going to want a strong Deutsche mark...I wouldn't rule out further cuts in repo rates further out,&quot; said Weatherby. CURRENCIES AT 1515 GMT The dollar was at 1.5055 marks and 111.50 yen, compared with 1.5015 marks and 111.38 yen in late European trade on Tuesday. STOCK MARKETS AT 1515 GMT LONDON - The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares was 8.3 points lower at 3,926.0. FRANKFURT - The 30-share DAX index closed up 39.13 points at 2,773.43. PARIS -  The CAC 40 index was down 13.53 points at 2215.78.

C13,C18,C183,C31,CCAT	 A lower house panel will meet again today to vote on a bill regulating Brazil's telecom sector and outlining the privatization of the federal Telebras system, a congressional official said. The committee will meet at 1400 local time/1300 EDT/1700 GMT to take up the proposed General Telecommunications Law after failing to vote on the bill Tuesday, the official said. The meeting will go forward despite a newspaper report linking Communications Minister Sergio Motta to a fresh corruption scandal in Congress.   &quot;It may have repercussions, but so far it hasn't affected our work,&quot; the official said of the allegations Motta provided some money to buy votes on a bill allowing President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to run for re-election. The scandal erupted Tuesday when daily Folha de Sao Paulo, quoting secretly taped phone conversations, reported that five members of the Chamber of Deputies allegedly took cash for their votes in favor of the re-election bill. The congressional official said the Special Telecommunications Committee was likely to cast votes on the new telecom law after the discussion session.   A vote Tuesday was put off due to lingering discord over a provision that does not stipulate the level of foreign capital participation in a fixed-line telecom operator. The bill, drafted by Deputy Alberto Goldman, would set no overall limit. But some lawmakers contend the measure should limit foreigners to a 49 percent stake, the same restriction placed on foreigners in cellular B Band concessions. The telecom bill also creates a regulatory watchdog for the sector called the National Telecommunications Agency (Antel).   The body would have the power to prevent investors or grops of investors from dominating the industry and would have its own budget to ensure autonomy. The bill also would: * Establish rules for granting concessions, licenses and authorizations to operate telecom services in  Brazil; * Ensure competition in the sector; * Create a fund to guarantee all Brazilians access to the country's telecom system; * And encourage research and development of new technology in the sector.   If approved by the panel, the bill will advance to the floor of the Chamber of Deputies and then to the Senate. (( -- James Craig, Brasilia newsroom 5561 223 0358))

C11,C42,CCAT,E41,ECAT,GCAT,GJOB	 Athletic shoe maker Reebok International Ltd. Thursday invited arch-rival Nike to team up and stamp out child labour at their factories around the world, particularly in Pakistan. &quot;This isn't about business principles. This is about making the world a little better,&quot; said Reebok Chairman Paul Fireman after an Executive Forum of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce meeting. &quot;This isn't a challenge. This is an invitation,&quot; he stressed. Fireman wrote to Phil Knight, his counterpart at Nike, after reading Knight's letter to his shareholders that spoke of an increased commitment to the human rights of workers making Nike products. &quot;I have a radical idea,&quot; Fireman wrote. &quot;Suppose you and I worked together on this issue... Through your position as leader of the most powerful brand, through our combined market share strength, and through Reebok's own experience in human rights, I think the partnership would be awesome.&quot; Both firms came under fire after press reports found their Pakistani subcontractors that make soccer balls used child labour. A company review &quot;found that 20 to 25 percent of the stitchers are between the ages of nine and 13,&quot; said Fireman, whose firm sponsors its own human rights award and various Amnesty International projects. The Pakistani families count on the children's income, he said, and &quot;are not looking for intervention with their way of life.&quot; So Reebok, which fired one contractor for using underage labour, &quot;is building a new facility which will be the home for all Reebok ball production, including stitching. We'll support education and vocational training for the children in the area,&quot; Fireman said. Nike spokesman Keith Peters said Knight was aware of Fireman's letter and &quot;it will take some time to consider it. Obviously, we've been considering a variety of things for weeks now. This is a new wrinkle and it deserves consideration.&quot; Knight, in a Sept. 16 letter to shareholders dealing specifically with criticism of Nike's labour practices in developing countries, wrote, &quot;For the past 18 months, we have hired Ernst &amp; Young to conduct unannounced audits to ensure adherence to our Code of Conduct. &quot;Within the next year, we will invite a group other than Ernst &amp; Young to review the factories making Nike shoes. We know these are the best shoe factories in the world, and we will encourage this independent group to make its findings public,&quot; Knight wrote. Peters said Nike will open five of its own facilities in Pakistan, the first one in Sialkot within the next eight weeks. Soccer, while still a fledgling sport in the United States, provides a multibillion dollar market worldwide for makers of apparel and sport equipment. &quot;I hope this proposal will help end the exploitation of children's labour,&quot; said Representative Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., one of the harshest critics. &quot;These two industry giants working with other labour and human rights organisations along with soccer ball industry could finally put an end to these practices.&quot;
C21,CCAT	 The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (BHP) said on Tuesday its crude oil and condensate production in August fell two percent to 5.72 million barrels from 5.80 million barrels in August 1995. Figures in the company's August production report show higher North West Shelf production and contributions from the Liverpool Bay field -- which commenced production in January -- were offset by slipping output from other Australian fields and the North Sea.   Liverpool Bay production remained constrained by a leak in the gas re-injection pipeline to Lennox. The re-injection pipeline would be replaced by the second quarter of calendar 1997, BHP said. Natural gas production moved up to 18.1 billion cubic feet in August from 17.5 billion cubic feet a year ago despite the sale of the Netherlands North Sea and North American gas assets. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) output from the North West Shelf inched 1.0 percent lower, while LPG sales rose 10.2 percent.
M14,M141,M142,M143,MCAT	 Oil prices fell on Tuesday as traders shrugged off potential supply threats from a strike in Nigeria and wrestled with the expiration of May futures contracts. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for May delivery closed down a steep 78 cents at $19.60 a barrel. Traders said crude oil imports from Nigeria may be curtailed soon due to a strike by contractors who handle the berthing and loading of tankers in Nigeria. The strike has caused a delay but no cancellations yet of Royal Dutch/Shell Group's oil exports from Nigeria. Shell's output of Nigerian &quot;bonny&quot; light crude has fallen to about half the normal 950,000 barrels per day. But position-squaring and jockeying by many traders ahead of the last trading day for May futures on Tuesday had pushed oil prices higher in recent days, setting the stage for a fallback. &quot;My feeling is we went up on some position strategies ahead of the expiry and now it dropped back to the $19 to $20 range which I think better matches the supply situation,&quot; said Pat Hughes, market analyst with Chevron Corp. in California. Hughes said refiners have been able to absorb some of the crude surplus in the U.S. Gulf that followed an influx of imports earlier this month, but he said a comfortable amount of crude was still available. Tracking the selling pressure in crude, May unleaded gasoline ended down 1.03 cents a gallon at 61.77 cents and May heating oil ended down 0.65 cent a gallon at 54.83 cents. At the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, the action was similar in coffee trading. Traders shrugged off a strike in Colombia and prices fell back as speculators took profits. Coffee for May delivery closed 3.70 cents a pound lower at 211.20 cents, compared to the life-of-contract high of 224.00 cents set on Monday. A strike by truck drivers in Colombia, the number two coffee exporter, did little to deter sellers as speculative commodity fund investors led the charge lower. &quot;People decided to take today to liquidate,&quot; said Albert Scalla, a trader with coffee trading firm Hencorp Becstone in Miami. &quot;It was all the funds.&quot; Talk that the three-day-old work stoppage in Colombia would come to a quick resolution may have also pressured values. Labor and management were slated to hold a second round of talks on Tuesday, but a union representative said he did not expect a resolution before the end of the week. &quot;If they come to an agreement, we'll have a sell-off,&quot; said Scalla. &quot;The longer they stay on strike, the more the physical pipeline will be affected.&quot; Coffee prices have more than doubled since November on tight stocks at roasters and reduced crop prospects. Copper prices staged a strong rally with speculative buying taking prices higher. Copper for May delivery at the COMEX in New York closed 2.70 cents a pound higher at 109.90. Traders said prices rose nervously against a background of the maintenance shutdown at Kennecott Corp's Utah Copper smelter, the forthcoming labor talks at Phelps Dodge's Chino copper mine, and the continuing strike of a small union at the Escondida copper mine in Chile, the world's biggest. Copper stocks at the London Metal Exchange fell 1,875 metric tons on Tuesday as inventories continue to drop from already low levels. &quot;The reality is the market had a good demand structure and it took a little technical push to get things going,&quot; said analyst Bill O'Neill of Merrill Lynch said. At the Chicago Board of Trade, grain markets continued to feel jittery about unseasonal cold weather and disastrous flooding in the Midwest. Both have delayed planting and hurt crops planted last fall and now struggling to get established.

C22,CCAT	 A wave of new index-linked Dutch equity funds has attracted more than a billion guilders ($540 million) by overcoming small investors' fears of losing their money. Issuers said these &quot;click funds&quot;, which use a mix of options to limit or eliminate downside risk, were proving very popular and that more money would inevitably flow into them. &quot;The so-called click funds appeal to the typically Dutch risk-averse attitude,&quot; said ING spokesman Wieger Sietsma. So far four banks and fund managers have launched funds which track the AEX index of 25 blue-chip Dutch shares, guaranteeing investors the benefits of a rise in the index, but protecting them against the risk of a possible fall. The funds differ but all promise to reimburse all, or almost all, of the initial investment if the index falls over a five-year period, or to match the index if it rises. Additionally, the funds lock in profits at a number of pre-determined index levels. Once one of these levels is reached, the fund &quot;clicks&quot; and retains the percentage gain achieved up to that point, even if the index drops again. Hence the name click fund. TWO TYPES OF INVESTORS DRAWN TO FUNDS Sietsma said the funds drew two types of investors: those who already invested in equities but were anxious that prices might be set to fall and those who had their money in savings accounts but had been enviously eyeing the long equities rally. In 1996 the AEX posted a total return, including dividend income, of more than 41 percent, while the AMX index of medium-sized companies achieved a total return of more than 69 percent. Anxious about missing the boat but wary of buying at what might turn out to be the market's peak, retail investors have gratefully embraced the protection provided by the new funds. Investors have also been wooed by assurances from the fund managers that capital gains on the click funds will be tax-free. Capital gains on straight equity investments have long been untaxed in the Netherlands but losses are not tax-deductible. GENERALE BANK FIRST IN THE FIELD Generale Bank was first to launch a click fund in the Netherlands, collecting almost 100 million guilders last summer for a fund with clicks on AEX index gains of 25 and 50 percent. Robeco followed, raising over 820 million guilders through two funds launched in October and December with clicks for every 10 percent the AEX rises up to 50 percent for the first fund and up to 60 percent for the second. ING raised some 270 million guilders in December for a fund with clicks on index gains of 25 and 50 percent. ING, Van Lanschot, Generale Bank and Robeco are all either launching or planning to launch new funds in the coming weeks. Generale Bank and Van Lanschot both buy baskets of shares which approximate the composition AEX index and hedge these with over-the-counter (OTC) options at different index levels. EXOTIC OPTIONS Robeco said it had bought three different sets of &quot;exotic&quot; OTC options from the Dutch co-operative bank Rabobank, while ING said only that it used a combination of puts and calls. Dealers said the launch of new click funds caused short-term upward pressure on share prices but that the effect was limited as purchases by the fund could be spread over several days. &quot;One could say speculatively that it might push the index up about one or 1.5 points on such a day,&quot; one dealer said. Share dealers and options traders said it was far more difficult to quantify the effect on prices of what happened when a fund was approaching one of its click levels. Sietsma said ING was considering applying the click fund formula to other baskets of shares than those in the AEX. &quot;We'll definitely come up with something, but we won't say what's cooking until we make an official announcement,&quot; he said.
GCAT,GDEF,GDIP	 U.S. Defence Secretary William Cohen informed the NATO allies on Thursday Washington favoured inviting only three new members -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic -- into the alliance next month, British Defence Minister George Robertson said.   Robertson told reporters &quot;the announcement by Secretary Cohen was pretty significant and will have a big effect on those who are here&quot;. Both Cohen and Robertson are attending a meeting of NATO defence ministers, their last session before a summit in Madrid on July 8-9 at which some of NATO's former enemies from communist Europe will be invited to join. A NATO source present at the meeting said the announcement by the U.S., by far NATO's most important member, had cleared shocked some other member states. France in particular had pushed for a broader enlargement to include Romania and possibly Slovenia. Earlier on Thursday White House spokesman Mike McCurry said in Washington that the U.S. position was firm. Asked if the U.S. might be over-ruled on the matter he replied &quot;That is not likely&quot;. NATO operates by consensus and the U.S. position is backed by several other countries. REUTER

Some socialist deputies had threatened to vote against the law unless National Economy Minister Yannos Papandoniou introduced changes to it. Papandoniou raised the annual income cap of mothers with more than three children to 3.0 million drachmas from an initial 2.0 million to qualify for benefits. He also increased the age of unmarried childern for which mothers can get a monthly bonus of 10,000 drachmas to 23 years from 18 years. --Dimitris Kontogiannis, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4
C18,C183,CCAT,E21,E211,ECAT,M11,MCAT	 Traders on the Nigerian stock exchange on Monday said they were disappointed with a 1997 budget which is seen as putting long-awaited privatisation on hold. Head of state General Sani Abacha said in his budget speech on Saturday that more consultation would have to take place before there could be any privatisation of state enterprises. &quot;It is a disappointment for the capital markets,&quot; said Emeka Nwandu of brokers Mainland Trust. &quot;It seems government is still not sure what it wants when it comes to privatisation.&quot; Dealers, hoping for hefty foreign investment, were in the forefront of those who had anticpated substantial privatisation of state-run industries -- including telecommunications, power generation and above all the oil industry. Finance minister, Anthony Ani, last year said he believed Nigeria should divest from both its oil production joint ventures and its troubled refineries. Pressure had also come from both the World Bank and local business to go wholeheartedly for privatisation as a means of stimulating sub-Saharan Africa's biggest economy, dulled by recession since 1993, when the country slid into crisis over annulment of an election that would have restored democracy. Official sources said Ani had failed to convince the ruling military council at a crucial budget meeting last week that it was desirable to embark on privatisation straight away. &quot;Nigeria will not be rushed into privatisation ... and the government will do it at its own pace,&quot; Ani told journalists after giving a detailed breakdown of the 1997 budget on Monday. He said a high powered committee would be set up in 1997 to explore the potentials for privatising the enterprises or encouraging them to operate on a commercial basis. &quot;One would definitely have expected something more categorical and less vague on privatisation,&quot; said Mike Itegboje, chief executive of TRW Stockbrokers. Traders saw a tiny glimmer of relief in the order for commercial and merchant banks to raise their minimum capital to 500 million naira from 50 million naira for commercial and 40 million naira for merchant banks. Nwandu said the measure should see more banks needing to raise capital on the market and boosting trade. &quot;Banks not already listed will come to the market for outright quotation while those quoted would increase their shareholding through rights and bonus issues,&quot; he said.

GCAT,GSPO	 Injured Robert Allenby travelled 19,000 km from his native Melbourne to dribble a single shot 35 yards down the first fairway at the Volvo Masters on Thursday. In a farcical episode, the Australian stood quietly on the tee chatting to onlookers while waiting for fog to lift, then took out his three-wood and off a backswing of no more than 18 inches, eased the ball off the tee. He then announced he was withdrawing from the tournament because of the fractured sternum he suffered in a car accident four weeks ago, and pledged the money he earned for the stroke -- which could be as much as $117,000 -- to charity. Allenby needed to hit one shot to satisfy a European Tour requirement that he played in the competition to qualify for the bonus money he would earn after the event. He is currently third on the money list and will collect the extra prize if his position remains unchanged after the event. The Australian looked embarrassed as he sat through the 45-minute delay at the Valderrama course before teeing off. Afterwards he promised his earnings would go to two children's charities -- the Challenge Cancer Support Network at home and the Teenager Cancer Trust. &quot;They are wonderful charities. Kids with cancer and blood disorders deserve every chance,&quot; he said. &quot;This was not for the money,&quot; he insisted, defending himself against charges of greed. &quot;I just wanted to preserve my position on the money list and I felt I deserved the money for the way I have played this year.&quot; Allenby, who won the French and English Opens and the British Masters on his way to earning $730,000 prize money this year, denied he made the trip simply to qualify for several more lucrative events next year. &quot;I am already in the U.S. Open and PGA, the British Open and the World Series. I'm probably also in the U.S. Masters, although their criteria are not as firm,&quot; he said. &quot;This is not ridiculous, though it may seem funny to many people that I came so far to hit just one shot,&quot; he said. &quot;The rules are there in black and white. They can't be broken for one person,&quot;. Allenby suffered his chest injury, along with cuts to his head and his upper lip that required 21 stitches, in a car crash in Spain. &quot;I still have sharp pains in my chest, like someone has planted an axe in there,&quot; he said. &quot;The only cure is rest. My knees and lower legs are sore too and it hurts to sneeze, breath, or laugh.&quot; He said his earliest return would be at Australian Open in late November, but even that might be too soon. &quot;The sternum could snap if I did too much, then I'd be out for six months to a year,&quot; he said. &quot;I know a man who broke his sternum 10 years ago and he still has pain.&quot;

E21,E211,ECAT,GCAT,GPOL	 House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer said Tuesday it was premature to start tax negotiations with the Clinton administration until Congress receives more information about the president's proposal. &quot;I don't see how we can begin to talk about negotiating a tax bill until we have the specificity of their tax proposals so that they're subject to be scored by the Joint (Tax) Committee,&quot; Archer told reporters after speaking at a tax conference.   Earlier in the tax conference, a White House aide had said it was hoped that the bipartisan working groups on five key issues including taxes could begin next week. Archer said he was sending Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin a letter asking for more details on Clinton's proposed tax provisions. &quot;I am sending him (Rubin) a letter today because we had been hopeful any day up to now that that specificity would have been available to us,&quot; Archer said. &quot;They've got to define their tax provisions. They can't just simply allude to them in generalities if we're to be able to get tax estimates on them,&quot; he said.   Archer said he was &quot;extremely hopeful&quot; that a bipartisan balanced budget agreement would be reached this year, adding that there was &quot;good will&quot; on both sides. He said he also believed that tax relief would be part of that budget accord and that he was hopeful there would be a broad-based capital gains tax cut included. Archer said he believed that other tax proposals likely to be included in a final agreement would include expanding individual retirement accounts, helping families with a child tax credit and a measure to &quot;ameliorate&quot; the estate tax.   &quot;I think all of those will be part of the ultimate tax package,&quot; he said. Archer said he hoped that negotiations with the administration would begin &quot;reasonably soon.&quot; Archer also told reporters that he favored phasing out the subsidy on ethanol. &quot;I'm not going to try to prejudge what my (proposal) will be on the tax bill, but it would not be out of the ordinary for it to be in my (proposal),&quot; Archer said about phasing out the ethanol subsidies.
GCAT,GPOL,GVOTE	 Romania's media on Monday hailed weekend elections as a triumph for the anti-communist opposition, which seems set for its first term in office in the Balkan country. Television exit polls suggest the Democratic Convention (CDR), a grouping of 15 parties led by academic Emil Constantinescu, triumphed in Sunday's parliamentary polls over the scandal-hit ruling leftist party of President Ion Iliescu. Newspapers described the vote as a victory for Constantinescu, without waiting for official results to confirm the sometimes dubious validity of the exit polls. Iliescu, an ex-communist in power since the 1989 revolution that toppled dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, scored less than he expected in the presidential race and faces a second round of voting against an invigorated Constantinescu on November 17. &quot;The Democratic Convention wins parliament comfortably, Iliescu and Constantinescu go shoulder to shoulder towards the run-off,&quot; said the independent Adevarul. &quot;We have defeated them,&quot; the partisan opposition newspaper Ziua said. The Central Election Bureau is due to start releasing official results later on Monday. Final figures could take days to clarify. But the margin of victory in the exit surveys suggest Romanians have voted decisively for change, finally rejecting ex-communists in favour of centrist reformists promising relief from continuing poverty. &quot;I feel that if the real results confirm the exit polls, we will have four years of hard work in front of us to offer the country four years of a better life,&quot; said Constantinescu after the exit polls were released. The CDR scored between 32 and 35 percent of the vote in the exit polls to 22-25 percent for Iliescu's Party of Social Democracy (PDSR), which the opposition blames for timid reforms and economic decline. The PDSR has run Romania, in one form or another, since the 1989 collapse of communism. Exit polls for the presidential race were split, with state television putting Iliescu three points ahead and two other surveys by private channels giving Constantinescu a thin edge. Newspapers said the PDSR's failure to improve living conditions during seven years at the helm was the reason for their defeat. &quot;People voted not so much for one or other candidate as for a better life,&quot; said the daily Curierul National, &quot;the immense majority of Romanians voted with their pockets.&quot; The CDR will need the support of ex-prime minister Petre Roman's Social Democratic Union (USD) and an ethnic Hungarian party to form a coalition. It faces the prospect of an uneasy &quot;cohabitation&quot; with Iliescu if the 66-year-old President wins a fresh term. After exit polls were released a glum Iliescu called for the PDSR to be included in a governing coalition, a demand certain to be rejected by the CDR, but indicative of political tension ahead. &quot;A centre-right coalition (of the CDR and USD) might be just as unstable and just as fragile as the centre-left coalition which ruled over the past four years,&quot; said Iliescu. Commentators noted the election outcome would amount to the first time since 1928 that Romania had undergone a peaceful transition of government through the ballot box. &quot;The election will be a big shock to Romanians,&quot; political analyst Bogdan Teodorescu told Reuters. &quot;We will learn that there can be change without anyone being killed. People no longer in power don't go to jail. Their heads are not cut off.&quot;

M14,M141,MCAT	 White sugar futures managed to retain most of the day's strength in the face of a downward correction to the fund-inspired rally seen at the start of the week, traders said on Friday. Trade selling ensured that nearby contracts stayed weak in the afternoon, with the bearish tone extending down the futures board. Light sell stops were touched on the way but then the selling dried up somewhat, as August and October edged up from session lows. At 1555 GMT August was $1.20 lower at $325.50 and October down $1.50 at $315.80. Volume reached 2,005 lots although this was boosted by crosses on August and the August/October spread which widened slightly to $9.80. Traders said the perception of seasonal tightness into Europe's summer months should keep nearby prices underpinned although sell orders at $330 and above would continue to cap August gains. London's perceived strength should make the August/July arbitrage a buy at current levels as the New York market is expected to weaken. Fund players in the raws still had to liquidate hefty long July positions before expiry on June 30 and the nearby arbitrage was already attracting sellers keen for quick daily profits, they said. Trading in Paris was confined to the two front contracts in a light total volume of 393 lots.

GCAT,GCRIM,GPOL	 Exiled Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka and 11 other dissidents on Wednesday were charged with treason by Nigeria's military government over a spate of recent bomb blasts in the country. They face the death penalty if convicted. Soyinka, who won the 1986 Nobel Prize for Literature and is a leading opponent Nigerian military leader Sani Abacha, said he was not suprised. &quot;We learned the decision to try us on treason charges had been taken before the recent violence...The whole thing is orchestrated. Abacha is trying to get rid of us,&quot; Soyinka said by telephone from California. &quot;Abacha is intensifying his attempts to eliminate us. He is heading towards sentencing us to death in absentia. This is what he's gunning for. This is why we have been charged with treason,&quot; he said. Along with Soyinka, others charged in absentia at a Lagos magistrate court were some exiled leaders of the opposition group NADECO, including former army chief Lieutenant-General Alani Akinrinade and war time information minister Anthony Enahoro. Eight of the dissidents are in the country and were brought to court, court officials. The case was adjourned to May 9. The case comes up just days before Nigeria holds the first multi-party poll since the army annulled a 1993 vote that was meant to restore democracy. Nigeria has been in crisis since then and Soyinka has consistently accused Abacha of smothering democracy in the populous west African state. Soyinka and some of those charged with him are fighting for the annulment to be reversed and for Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of the vote, to be freed and installed as president. Abiola was jailed in 1994 when he declared himself president. Political sources said they did not expect the case to affect the local council poll scheduled for Saturday in which five recently registered political parties would be vying to run town halls in more than a thousand local councils nationwide. Soyinka and many opposition figures fled Nigeria two years ago to Europe and the United States, where they have campaigned against the military government. Political sources said charging them could pave the way for Nigeria to try to get them extradited back home. The accused face a two count charge of &quot;conspiracy to levy war against the federal military government of Nigeria&quot; and &quot;causing explosions in various parts of Nigeria.&quot; Others on the charge sheet Frederick Fasehun, president of the Campaign for Democracy pressure group as well as former finance minister Olu Falae. The last two have been detained since December after a spate of bomb explosions hit army buses, killing at least three soldiers and wounding several dozens. A Lagos high court judge on Wednesday ordered that Fasehun be released. Charging him formally before a magistrate court now makes his release unlikely because capital offences are not bailable. Police have publicly blamed Soyinka and NADECO for the bombs and while both have denied any involvement, Soyinka refused in an interview with BBC radio to condemn the bombings. Abacha, who seized power in the chaos that followed the 1993 poll annulment, is implementing a transition plan he says will see him hand power to a democratically-elected president in October 1998. But his critics dismiss the transition programme, saying he intends to use it to retain power.
GCAT,GSPO	 Swiss Alex Zuelle, second in 1995 and a pre-race favourite, withdrew from the Tour de France on Thursday. The Once team leader, a faller on three successive days this week, failed to make the start of the 261.5 km fifth stage from Chantonnay and Chatre. &quot;Alex Zuelle, who has suffered a lot of incidents since the start of the Tour, does not want to take any more risks in order not to jeopardise the rest of his season. He is therefore a non-starter this morning,&quot; Tour organisers announced. Zuelle escaped injury in the crashes but had dropped to 73rd overall, four minutes 17 seconds behind leader Mario Cipollini of Italy. The Swiss, winner of last year's Tour of Spain, also suffered two bad crashes last month, breaking his collarbone in the Tour of Switzerland. His fifth-place finish in Saturday's prologue time trial reassured his followers that he was in good shape, but between Monday and Wednesday he had the bad fortune to be involved in mass pile-ups that have marred the early days of the Tour. Veteran compatriot Tony Rominger, leader of the French Cofidis team, crashed out of his last Tour on Tuesday when he suffered a double fracture of the right collarbone in a fall. Spaniard Vicente Garcia-Acosta and Italy's Fabiano Fontanelli pulled out injured on Wednesday after a multiple crash in which the Italian ran into a woman spectator who was also badly hurt.

G15,G159,GCAT,GCRIM	 One person in three living in the European Union does not feel safe walking in his or her own neighbourhood after dark, a survey commissioned by the 15-nation bloc revealed on Thursday. The survey, based on interviews with 16,000 EU residents, showed that while EU citizens may not feel any safer than U.S. citizens, they are still more at ease than their neighbours in eastern Europe, where one in two is scared to go out at night. Within the European Union, people living in the former East Germany feel most at risk from crime, where almost two people out of three are afraid to go out after dark, the survey said. Next in line are residents of Spain (39 percent), Ireland (37 percent), Portugal (34 percent) and western Germany (34 percent), according the survey, presented to a seminar on urban delinquency and its links with drugs dependence. &quot;Comparing the rates of global regions show that the EU safety level in urban areas is similar to that in North America and Asia,&quot; the European Commission said in a statement of the survey, prepared at the Dutch State University of Leiden. It said that contacts with drugs scenes increased the fear. Fourteen percent of those interviewed said they had seen people openly dealing with drugs, found syringes in parks or been victims of drugs-linked violent crime. But the survey showed that people were also put off by teenagers loitering on streetcorners, litter on the streets, graffiti, beggars and tramps, along with abandoned houses and broken windows. While 44 percent of women were afraid, 19 pecent of men were, although the survey admitted men might be too macho to admit that they were scared. The fear increased according to the size of the city and was more prevalent in younger and older people and among people with less money. &quot;The unequal distribution of fear...can be illustrated by a comparison between two extreme groups. Of the young males living in villages nine percent feel unsafe. By contrast 62 percent of women of 55 and older living in the Union's largest cities feels unsafe,&quot; it said. People in Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands and Austria feel the safest when compared to their EU partners about going out at night. Only 11 percent of Danes said they were too scared to go out.

C13,C21,C31,CCAT,GCAT,GPOL	 Algerian President Liamine Zeroual on Thursday formally set up a National Energy Council to act as a watchdog on the OPEC member's long-term energy reserves. The official Algerian news agency APS said the council will &quot;follow and evaluate national energy policy in the long term and the preservation of the country's strategic energy reserves&quot;. Zeroual will head the council whose main mission will be to draw up long-term strategies for renewing and developing hydrocarbon reserves, APS said. The North African country relies on oil and gas exports for nearly 95 percent of its foreign income and has for the past few years been opening up to foreign operators both to improve recovery levels and find new reserves for development. Algeria has an OPEC quota of 750,000 barrels per day (bpd). According to Reuters latest survey of wellhead flows it was producing 840,000 bpd in November. Early last month, Algeria inaugurated a gas pipeline with an annual capacity of 9.5 billion cubic metres of natural gas, running from its Hassi R'mel field in the Sahara Desert, across northern Morocco to Spain. It is also to link up with Portugal's gas distribution network. Last Tuesday, Algerian Energy Minister Amar Makhloufi said:

C13,CCAT,M14,M143,MCAT	 European gas oil traders on Wednesday said tough new gas oil contract rules brought in by London's oil futures exchange could hit liquidity but others said they would prevent damaging speculation. Some large players criticised the imposition by the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) of tight new limits on traders holding large interest positions ahead of each month's gas oil contract expiry. They warned the rules would crimp participation and suck liquidity out of a market that had traditionally attracted a broad range of users with varying needs. &quot;I would have thought that the limit provided here  is not enough for some people - and I mean the legitimate traders,&quot; said one veteran broker. Smaller players tended to welcome the changes. They said they would enhance price discovery by narrowing differences between physical and futures values and protect smaller players seeking to hedge. &quot;This is good because there is still a lot of speculation in the market, especially in the last trading days,&quot; said one Rotterdam trader. &quot;It sounds a bit stiff, but if it gets rid of the squeezes, then the IPE will have done a wonderful job,&quot; said a German trader. But one trader who has squeezed the market on previous occasions and normally deals in several thousand of lots a day said: &quot;It will be a shock for most of the industry.&quot; &quot;It's very likely now that we will limit our activities in favour of other markets, OTCs and stuff like that. We didn't expect such low limits. &quot;With these kind of rules it doesn't make sense to really play this market really actively anymore. You won't have any fear in the market anymore. It's going to be just a very fundamental market with low volatility.&quot; The changes, reported by traders who have been given advance word of the details, were agreed on Monday by the IPE board of directors and will be announced formally at 1500 GMT on Wednesday in London. They new rules are that IPE clients would be fined 100 percent of their entire open position if they exceed 3,500 lots of open interest in the five business days before expiry. A fine of 50 percent of the contract value will be levied if the open interest exceeds 7,000 lots in the 6-10 days before expiry. The fine falls to 25 percent of the contract value in if the open interest exceeds 12,500 lots in the 11-15 days before expiry. Market observers said the new IPE rules reflect a attempt to strike a balance between keeping traded volumes at a healthy level while guarding against potentially damaging speculative squeezes which can disrupt physical trade. The trader who has squeezed the market added: &quot;For us this market doesn't make sense anymore. What can you do with 3,000 contracts? Nothing.&quot; But one Hamburg trader with a long record of substantial activity on the gas oil contract welcomed the rules. &quot;This is what we have been working towards with the IPE and others,&quot; he said. &quot;It limits the possibility of funny traders to play around with the rules. It doesn't stop you from squeezing the market if you feel like it but it does tell you to have the oil when you make delivery.&quot; The changes are aimed at preventing a repeat of a trading company row which disrupted European heating oil supplies last winter. The stand-off between Cargill and AIC last November caused a delay in gas oil supplies against expiry of the IPE contract. The fall in open interest in the November contract last year was quick, but not quick enough to prevent a huge delivery of physical oil. Trading house Cargill was required to take delivery of most of a record 865,100 tonnes of gas oil from competitor AIC. Traders at the time called on the IPE to impose stiff penalties. There were 8,651 lots of open interest on the day of expiry last November having fallen from a high level of 28,007 lots just six days before. This represents a 69 percent drop over six days. This compares with an average drop of 89 percent over the past twelve months from 18,285 lots six days ahead of expiry to 1,923 lots at expiry. Total volume of the IPE gas oil contract has flattened out in the past couple of years. In 1994 average monthly volume was 315,275 lots, in 1995 374,393 and last year 363,560 lots despite big price volatility. So far this year it has averaged 345,523 lots. The veteran trader said the regulations might distort vital spread trading ahead of expiry. &quot;You're going to start screwing up the spreads because with three date ranges you're forcing people to wind down positions in stages. I'd like to know how they arrived at these numbers -- just out of the blue? &quot;My question is, is this in any way shape or form facilitating the physical method of making and taking delivery?&quot; --William Maclean London newsroom +44 171 542 7646
M11,M13,M132,M14,M142,MCAT	 European stocks made healthy gains on Wednesday, helped by Wall Street's overnight rally to another record close but trading was edgy because of higher interest rate fears. On the currency front, the dollar strengthened with a weak Tokyo stock market eroding the yen but markets were mostly content to bide their time ahead of important U.S. jobs and prices data due later this week. London, Europe's biggest stock exchange, climbed 0.3 percent after losses on Tuesday. Business, however, was cautious despite New York's late recovery because of interest rate anxiety and Wall Street's recent volatility. &quot;It's been another lacklustre morning,&quot; one senior dealer said. &quot;People are starting to worry that interest rates may be pushed up sooner rather than later.&quot; Market talk of higher British interest rates intensified after the deputy governor of the Bank of England late on Tuesday said there was a need for a small rate rise to achieve the government's inflation target. &quot;There is talk around the market this morning that we could see a rate hike as early as next week,&quot; the trader said. Other European bourses made a good start after Wall Street's strong showing but the mood was nervous because of worries that record-breaking levels of recent weeks could not be sustained much longer. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average on Tuesday closed above 6,600 points for the first time but bonds fell on fears that the U.S. economy might be growing so fast that the Federal Reserve central bank might be prompted to raise rates. The Dow clawed back early losses to end up 33.48 points at a record 6,600.66, surpassing Monday's peak of 6,567.18. &quot;The bond market is telling us that U.S. interest rates are going up but so far Wall Street is ignoring the bonds,&quot; one trader said in London. French stocks put on the strongest performance, climbing by over one percent by lunchtime. Shares in Dassault Aviationand Dassault Electronique rallied 4.86 percent and 6.13 percent, respectively, after the government asked the privatisation commission to study the Aerospatiale-Dassault Aviation merger. The newspaper La Tribune said state-owned Aerospatiale and Dassault Aviation may team up with engineering group Alcatel Alsthom in a joint bid for defence electronics company Thomson-CSF. Alcatel shares were up 1.93 percent at 422.80 francs. The company declined comment.     But the market mood was was cautious ahead of two important U.S. indicators due out on Thursday and Friday, the December producer price index and the unemployment rate, which would give pointers on the health of the U.S. economy. In Frankfurt, shares climbed by 0.6 percent but again traders said many investors were sitting on the fence ahead of the U.S. price and jobs data. &quot;The steady dollar and a higher Wall Street are helping today,&quot; said one dealer. There was little concerted buying, however, because of the upcoming American statistics. The dollar climbed against yen helped by plummetting Tokyo stocks, which closed at a 13-month low on Wednesday, reflecting a deepening gloom over government efforts to revive the flagging economy. The dollar rose to over 115.80 yen and dealers said there were no new comments from Japanese officials about the yen's value. Recent warnings about the negative impact of a weaker yen have eroded dollar strength against the Japanese currency. The dollar also advanced by over a half a pfennig as the mark drifted against other European currencies with the market awaiting Thursday's release of German December unemployment data. CURRENCIES AT 1200 GMT The dollar was quoted around 1.5705 marks and 115.80 yen compared with 1.5634 and 115.25 in late European trade on Tuesday. STOCK MARKETS AT 1200 GMT The FTSE 100 index of key British shares was 12.5 points higher at 4,091.3. The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt was up 18.11 at 2,904.24. In Paris, the CAC-40 index was up 24.23 at 2,325.92. PRECIOUS METALS Gold was fixed at $355.80 an ounce, well below Tuesday's London close of $359.35. Silver was at $4.66, down six cents.

C31,C313,C32,CCAT	 New Zealand brewing giant Lion Nathan on Thursday started a campaign designed to win back its sagging share of the Australian beer market, the New Zealand Press Association reported. Over the past decade, Lion has lost its position as the market leader to Fosters Brewing Group, slipping to about 40 percent of the $A6 billion (NZ$6.8 billion) industry from a high of a 50 percent share in the late 1980s. Its current share is believed to be its lowest to date.   Lion claims it is the lowest cost producer of the beer industry in Australia and is, therefore, in a strong position to reclaim lost ground by launching a new national product that meets market acceptance. The company's new strategy will focus on a relaunch of the upmarket label Hahn Premium as well relaunching Sydney Bitter in Australia's biggest city. Until now, Hahn Premium has only been promoted in New South Wales but a new campaign -- understood to have been conceived by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi -- will aim for national prominence.   Hahn Premium will be Lion's attempt to counter Fosters' flagship Crown Lager, which has 40 percent of the premium market, estimated to be worth $A120 million. Lion believes this area can be expanded by targeting high and middle income earners and urging them to switch from wine and spirits. Fosters, which increased its profits by 2 percent in the past financial year to $A293.3 million, has its own summer strategy to rival that of Lion. --Wellington Newsroom (64 4) 4734746

M12,MCAT	 Argentine bonds were much lower late Monday, slumping on concerns the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike rates next week. &quot;The market fell amid very thin volume. Investors are reducing their portfolios,&quot; said a trader. Argentina's FRB due 2005 fell 5/8 to 89-1/4, while the dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 dropped $0.50 to 125.85. Another trader said there were no buyers in the market Monday, as an increasing amount of players have been spooked by the potential of a hike in U.S. rates.   Despite the fact that the Federal Open Market Committee will not be meeting until March 25, traders predicted activity would pick up before that. Tuesday's auction of 250 million pesos of 91-day Letes, and 500 million pesos of 364-day Letes treasury bills could spur a pick-up in market activity. But the release of U.S. consumer prices on Wednesday is the week's most eagerly awaited event as traders hope the figures could give clues on what the Federal Reserve will decide to do on March 25. Call money rates were flat at 5.98 percent. ((--Axel Bugge, Buenos Aires Newsroom, 541 318-0668))
GCAT,GCRIM	 Papua New Guinea, under siege from a wave of violence, on Wednesday declared a week-long gun amnesty to encourage the surrender of home-made guns and stolen military firearms and grenades. Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan urged people to surrender illegal firearms before the amnesty ends on Christmas Day, adding that the amnesty would also cover grenades and bombs. &quot;If you are scared of surrendering it yourself, you can pass it to a priest, pastor or any community leaders who will act on your behalf,&quot; Chan said in announcing the amnesty. The government last month also imposed a two-month dusk-to-dawn curfew in the mountainous country's main cities and towns in an attempt to stem a crime wave. The gun amnesty came at the request of Papua New Guinea Police Commander Robert Nenta, who is struggling to control crime, particularly in the capital Port Moresby which has experienced a spate of bank robberies, rapes and car thefts. Port Moresby is known as one of the world's most dangerous cities. Rising unemployment and urban drift has led to the growth of criminal gangs in recent years and large parts of the city centre are no-go areas for tourists and foreign residents. Criminal gangs called &quot;rascals&quot; have staged several shoot-outs with police in the streets of the capital in recent months, prompting police to be given shoot-to-kill orders. Gangs are normally armed with high-powered rifles, handguns and machetes, although police recovered a stolen defence force grenade launcher after one shoot-out. A recent stock-take of military and police arms has found large numbers of military issue firearms and ammunition missing. While not releasing details of what is missing, officials say the firearms have ended up in the hands of criminals.
M11	 A fiesty Australian share market fought its way to a record close on Friday, extending the resilient rearguard action started on Thursday afternoon as stocks eked out modest gains in most sectors. The finish surpasses the previous record close of 2,444.2, reached on January 20, 1997, but falls well short of the all time intraday high of 2,456.7, reached on the same day. The All Ordinaries index added 11.5 points to 2,446.7. &quot;It's been a fairly good effort,&quot; said dealer Phillip Toop of Brisbane-based brokerage, Lance Jones. &quot;It's not across the board but certainly performances like CRA and Lend Lease were pretty strong and Commonwealth Bank held up well after what has been an incredible run for them ahead of their result.&quot; Major miner CRA led the pack all day, its shares up over two percent to an intraday high of A$18.70 (US$14.21) before easing to close 1.9 percent higher at A$18.58. Brokers said an upgrade by a London stockbroker of its dual-listed entity partner, RTZ Corp Plc, had fuelled the rise. Traders said shares in tightly held property and financial services conglomerate, Lend Lease Corporation, gained good ground as investors went in search of blue chip industrials. Its shares closed 55 cents higher at A$23.80. Commonwealth Bank extended its record breaking run, closing at its highs of A$13.50 as traders sought exposure ahead of the bank's upcoming first half profit result. Helix Resources jumped ahead again, closing over three percent higher at A$4.85 after gold major Acacia Resources said it bought 17 percent of the Gawler Craton gold hopeful. However, Acacia shares lost ground, losing 15 cents to A$2.24. Victorian gold explorer Ballarat Goldfields topped turnover with 49.27 million shares traded, the bulk of it in one line of 44.46 million shares specialled through Hartley Poynton at a price of 7.1 cents per share. The company told Reuters its major shareholder, Resolute Ltd, had sold out with the shares spread to a range of Hartley Poynton clients. Shale oil hopefuls, the Rundle twins, soared after the company released a progress report on its Stuart shale oil project in central Queensland. Southern Pacific Petroleum shares climbed 20 cents to A$4.10 while Central, Pacific Minerals leapt 90 cents to A$10.00. Rises outnumbered falls by a ratio of about five to three, while about 29 percent of stocks traded remained steady. (A$1 = US$0.76)

GCAT,GCRIM	 Four men went on trial on Monday for the brutal murder of a communist-era former Polish prime minister and his wife during a burglary in 1992. The first suspect to testify proclaimed his innocence. &quot;I had nothing to do with it,&quot; the private Radio Zet quoted the man, identified only as Henryk S. as saying. Prosecutor Artur Kassyk accused the four men of strangling 83-year-old Piotr Jaroszewicz, who was prime minister between 1970 and 1980, and of shooting his wife Alicja in the head at close range during a burglary at their suburban Warsaw villa. &quot;Mutilation of his head, bruises... broken neckbones show that the victim was subjected to tortures for a long time before his death,&quot; Kassyk told the Warsaw Provincial Court. There was no word on how the other three suspects were pleading. If convicted, the men, three 54-year-olds and one aged 41, could face the death penalty, which remains on the books in Poland although there is a moratorium on its implementation. The prosecutor said material rather than political motives were involved in the crime and the men apparently did not even know that they were attacking a prominent figure. Jaroszewicz had a reputation as &quot;Moscow's man in Warsaw&quot; and was widely disliked during his term, which coincided with the communist party leadership of Edward Gierek and which brought Poland to an economic crisis in 1980.

E21,E212,ECAT	 The New York City Water Finance Authority on Monday said that retail investors had only ordered $12 million of bonds by the close of a two-day presale period, as demand was hurt by the market's recent big losses. &quot;It's a tough market,&quot; said a Water Finance official, who declined to be named.   The Authority early Monday sweetened the terms for retail investors, raising yields by 20 basis points, with a top yield of 5.40 percent in 2018. When Treasuries on Friday tumbled just over two points because the latest economic data on payrolls and manufacturing showed surprising strength, reviving inflation fears, the Authority sold around $4 million of bonds to individual investors on the first day of the presale period. Whether the size of the planned bond sale, which was pegged at $365 million, will be adjusted is a decision that will be made on Tuesday. Asked whether the offering's size would be cut, the official replied &quot;I wouldn't draw any conclusions, probably lowered.&quot; ((--Joan Gralla, 212-859-1654))

M14,M141,MCAT	 The sugar market saw a spate of new orders to start the week with Latin American origins continuing as the focus of demand, shipbrokers said on Monday. The only fixture of the day came from E D &amp; F Man, said to have covered its recent order for 6,000 tonnes of bagged sugar from Continent to Syria for November. Details of the rate have yet to emerge. Elsewhere, 6,500 tonnes of white sugar were delivered against the expiry of the Matif December futures contract in Paris, with the port specified as Gdansk. The seller was reported to be Node Langlois and the buyer Commerciale DWD. In London, where the December futures contract also expired on Friday, 11,750 tonnes of white sugar were delivered. Refco was the receiver of all the sugar, and was also the seller along with E D &amp; F Man. The ports specified were Gdynia, Gdansk, Eemshaven and Rostock. Louis Dreyfus amended a couple of recent orders and was also open for 3,150 tonnes min/max bagged sugar from Antwerp to Dakar for prompt shipment dates. Czarnikow Rionda was in the market with three bagged sugar orders from Latin American origins. It quoted for 14,000 tonnes from Santos to the Red Sea with options of east Africa and Karachi for 1/5 December and a further same-sized spot cargo from Veracruz to the Mediterranean. Rionda was also open for 12,000 tonnes from Buenaventura to west Africa/Mediterranean for 25 November/5 December, with an option to raise tonnage to 14,000 tonnes. Genoc quoted for 13/14,000 tonnes min/max bagged sugar from north or south Brazil to Mediterranean, Black Sea, Red Sea or Indian Ocean for prompt/14 days notice. It was also in the market for 10/14,000 tonnes, again in bags, from Gdynia/Gdansk to Algeria with Egypt, Red Sea, Pakistan and Colombo options for prompt/10 days notice. Cargill issued two new orders, shipbrokers said. It was in the market for 12,600 to 15,400 tonnes of bagged sugar from Continent to west Mediterranean or Egyptian ports for 21/29 November. Cargill also quoted for 14,000 tonnes in bulk from Verzcruz to Morocco, east Mediterranean and Black Sea options for 5/10 December, they said. Market sources said CSR issued an order for a rescheduled 40,000-tonne bulk cargo from Queensland to Jeddah for 11/21 December. Secretan repeated some of its European orders from last week but also quoted for new bagged tonnage from Brazil. It was open for 6,000 tonnes from north Brazil to west Africa for 29 November/5 December and a further 12/14,000 tonnes from Santos to east Africa for 25/29 November. Secretan also quoted for 5,000 tonnes of pre-slung bagged sugar from Rouen to Nouakchott for 1/5 December. -- Jeremy Smith, London Newsroom +44 171 542 8064

GCAT,GCRIM	 Attorneys for Jeffrey MacDonald, a U.S. Army doctor accused of killing his pregnant wife and two young daughters, have asked for a new trial based on recent allegations the FBI crime lab mishandled evidence. The Feb. 17, 1970, killing at Fort Bragg was the subject of newspaper stories, movies and books, the best known of which was &quot;Fatal Vision&quot; by Joe McGinniss, and the case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. MacDonald, 53, who is serving three life sentences in a federal prison in Sheridan, Oregon, has staunchly maintained his innocence. &quot;I think there still is unease about this case,&quot; he said in an interview in Wednesday's Charlotte Observer. &quot;It is one of those events when the country was in so much turmoil that it is imprinted on people's brains.&quot; MacDonald contends four &quot;drug-crazed hippies&quot; repeatedly stabbed him on the night of the killings, leaving him unconscious while they bludgeoned his family with a club. His defence had tried and failed to reopen the case in 1990. In the 1,500 pages of documents filed in U.S. District Court in Raleigh on Tuesday, his defence team said the judge who rejected the appeal for a new trial in 1990 had relied on testimony from Michael Malone, an FBI fiber specialist who was criticised in a U.S. Justice Department report last week. The report said the FBI's crime laboratories had provided flawed evidence in several major cases including the Oklahoma City and World Trade Centre bombings. After the report, FBI officials said several hundred cases were being reviewed for exculpatory evidence that would help defendants win new trials or overturn their convictions but expressed confidence the government would prevail in most.

C21,C31,CCAT	 IBP Inc this week slowed production at all of its U.S. beef operations and plans on continued reductions next week unless the beef market improves, said Gary Mickelson, company spokesman. &quot;Our beef plants are operating at reduced hours this week, with most running 40 hours or less,&quot; Mickelson said. &quot;We generally like to run our plants 48 hours a week, six days a week,&quot; Mickelson said. Sluggish beef movement and fewer cattle being marketed at current prices spurred the production cutbacks, he said.   IBP, based in Dakota City, Neb., operates 11 fed cattle beef plants and four cow beef boning plants in the U.S. IBP also operates a fed cattle beef plant in Brooks, Alberta, Canada, which will not be affected by the production slowdown, Mickelson said. Excel Corp, a unit of  Cargill Inc earlier Wednesday announced plans to reduce beef production at its six beef plants starting Saturday due to unprofitable market conditions. Officials with other major meat packing companies were unavailable for comment Wednesday afternoon regarding their operations. The U.S. Agriculture Department on Wednesday estimated cattle slaughter at 128,000 head compared with 131,000 a week ago and 131,000 a year ago. Week to date slaughter was estimated at 392,000 head, compared with 384,000 last week and 389,000 last year. ((Bob Janis 312-983-7347))

Audrey Ho, head of research at Mohaiyani Securities said: &quot;We view the profit taking as a healthy sign.&quot; Share scrip deliveries after heavy trading eight days ago contributed to the downward pressure, she said. Ho also said that foreign institutional funds were seen selectively &quot;nibbling&quot; at blue-chip stocks. YTL Corp was up 40 cents at 13.20 ringgit after posting a 57.5 percent gain in net profits for the year ended June 30, 1996.

C12,C13,CCAT,GCAT,GCRIM	 Bulgaria's telecommunications and electricity companies, suffering huge losses from stolen copper power and telephone cables, called on Friday for stricter controls on scrap merchants. Officials from the National Electricity Company (NEC) and the Bulgarian Telecommunications Company (BTC) told Reuters scrap merchants paid good prices for high voltage power cables and wires without asking where they came from. State-owned NEC has reported direct losses of more than 60 million levs ($115,000) from stolen cables, transformers and other equipment for the first nine months of the year. In 1995 the company's direct losses were 300 million levs, or 10 percent of the funds earmarked for repairs of the electricity network in 1996. The last big power cable theft was on November 20 when a 1.2-tonne copper cable was stolen in the area between the village of Dolni Bogrov and Krivina, some 10 km (six miles) east of Sofia. &quot;It is high time for amendments in the legislation aimed at curbing the theft,&quot; an NEC report said, adding that the company had proposed to the cabinet amendments to the decree controlling the purchase of non-ferrous metals. Police have reported deaths from electrocution among the thieves, who climb pylons to cut high-voltage cables. State-owned telecommunications monopolist BTC spent more than 5.7 million levs on replacing stolen wires this year, company spokeswoman Vera Pavlova told Reuters. The biggest theft this year, which hit the company with a loss of more than two million levs, was last week in Sofia, Pavlova said, adding that police had arrested the thieves. &quot;Strict control should be exercised on scrap merchants so that they will buy only metal of proven origin,&quot; she said. A government official said there were a number of firms authorised to buy copper for recycling but some of them did not care whether the metal was stolen. On Thursday, Bulgarian state television reported that two men had been arrested for stealing bronze statues. They usually sold the the stolen metal to the scrap buyer at night and he smelted it early in the following morning. If the police arrived late, they would not be able to find the original metal and would have no evidence against the sellers, the television said. ($=523 levs)
E51,E512,ECAT	 China, hoping to speed up its stalled entry into the World Trade Organisation, promised on Friday not to make new laws or policies which violate WTO rules. The commitment, announced by assistant trade minister Long Yongtu at a meeting of the WTO working party negotiating the terms of Beijing's entry into the 125-member watchdog, was welcomed by major trading nations. These included the United States, European Union, Japan, Canada, South Korea and New Zealand, trade officials said. Long, speaking to reporters, said he had detected a &quot;much more pragmatic and positive&quot; attitude on the part of the U.S. delegation led by Deborah Lehr, deputy assistant U.S. trade representative. U.S. and Chinese trade officials held closed-door bilateral negotiations in Geneva on Monday and Tuesday. &quot;They have taken away some purely bilateral trade issues outside the WTO framework,&quot; Long said, referring to the U.S. &quot;We agreed not to put all our laundry into one basket.&quot; &quot;We think things are on the right track,&quot; Long added, declining to predict when China might gain entry into the club. Lehr was not available for comment. A U.S. trade delegate in Geneva said acting U.S. trade representative Charlene Barshefsky was the only USTR official authorised to speak regarding China. Trade officials said Lehr, in remarks to Friday's meeting, had welcomed the standstill commitment as marking a sign of China's serious intent to begin the negotiations in earnest, calling it a foundation on which to move ahead. Chinese officials have blamed the United States for blocking their accession to the global trade club, saying it has been linked to bilateral rows over Taiwan, human rights and copyright piracy as well as annual battles over conditions attached by Washington to granting China most favoured nation trade status. Pierre-Louis Girard, a Swiss who chairs the WTO working party studying China's application of 1987 to the predecessor body the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, announced he would look into holding the next formal talks in late February. He called for bilateral negotiations between China and its trading partners in the interim. China's annexes on its non-tariff measures such as pricing, import licensing and state trading -- which form an integral part of the draft accession protocol -- were discussed in the closed-door talks, according to trade officials. Most countries saw substantial progress on it, they added. Girard called for more progress on phase-out of subsidies and products subject to statutory inspection. &quot;In order to ensure future negotiations to be carried out on a stable basis and to demonstrate China's sincerity to accelerate the negotiation, we hereby announce the decision of the Chinese government to undertake the principle of standstill, and commit ourselves that China will not promulgate new laws and policies inconsistent with the WTO rules during the negotiation process,&quot; Long said in a speech to the closed-door meeting. &quot;And in that spirit, we sincerely hope that the WTO members will not raise the threshold and increase trade restrictions against China in the meantime,&quot; he added. &quot;We believe that there is now a better opportunity for us to finally reach a package of agreements on the (accession) protocol and market acess through substantive negotiations.&quot; The so-called &quot;standstill&quot; commitment is standard for countries in an advanced stage of negotiations, giving their trading partners a benchmark by which to measure them. &quot;This announcement of course was welcomed by major trading nations, by everybody in the room,&quot; said one official. The EU's Roderick Abbott said the Chinese pledge was very positive and announced his delegation would hold bilateral talks with the Chinese delegation on Tuesday. He called for all WTO members and Beijing to be flexible and innovative so as to find a solution. Japan said the working party, the first since last March, had been productive and Tokyo supported early accession.
C15,C152,CCAT	 Russian bank Sberbank broke through the $200 barrier on Tuesday, but most investors focused on undervalued second-tier companies likely to see the most investor interest in the short term, traders said. At 1200 GMT, two hours before close, the Russian Trading System (RTS) 22-share index had dipped to 365.55 from Monday's 365.64 close. Volume was not available for technical reasons. Sberbank, which has gained over 30 percent since early last week, shortly after its RTS listing, closed at $204.00 after $196.50 at the previous close. A Renaissance Capital trader said a Sberbank order that had to be filled had helped push the price up over $200. Sberbank recently has been rated a buy by a number of banks, as well. Traders said that in the absenxe of new funds from the West, traditionally the strongest influence on this market, investors were reallocating portfolios to pick undervalued second tier companies. &quot;The second and third tiers saw strong demand -- these markets are already nearing (the first tier),&quot; said Creditanstalt trader Andrei Galperin. But he said investors could be forced to rethink their positions in a couple of weeks as second tier valuations closed in on those of the first tier. Trinfiko trader Grigory Pinsky said lower first quarter earnings for local energo Mosenergo  had pushed the price down but that the share had been losing its prestige for some time. It closed at $1.267 after $1.273. &quot;People have been selling it for a long time already. This just gave the sellers a bit more enthusiasm,&quot; he said. --Olga Popova, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520
E41,E411,ECAT,GCAT,GJOB	 President Alexander Lukashenko has ordered unemployed people in Belarus to work for their keep, a decree in official newspapers on Wednesday showed. From April 15 payments will stop to the former Soviet republic's jobless, or 3.32 percent of the work force in February -- unless they carry out &quot;social&quot; tasks, it said. Lukashenko, whose authoritatarian style has been criticised in the West though he has broad support at home, has ordered the government to set tasks for the jobless to carry out. The unemployed earned 180,545 Belarussian roubles -- or less than $10 -- in February, the Statistics Ministry said. The decree said the number of unemployed should not exceed 130,000 people this year out of a population of 10 million. But the Statistics Ministry said the number of unemployed on March 1 had risen to 183,243 from 184,787 a month before.

Monday reported a loss for its fourth quarter after paying for acquisitions and a restructuring and said demand for its computer memory management products declined. Quarterdeck, which develops personal computer and Internet software, also said it set aside additional reserves for product returns during the quarter. Quarterdeck had a net loss of $54.8 million, or $1.53 a share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with profits of $277 million, or 1 cent a share, in the year-ago period. Revenues edged down to $32.1 million from $34.2 million.

M11,MCAT	 Egyptian share prices slipped a fraction on Wednesday but brokers said they thought the market was stabilising after the stiff correction of recent weeks. The Capital Market Authority's all-share index fell 0.18 points to close at 396.71 from 396.89 on Tuesday in average turnover of 95.52 million pounds ($28.14 million). The brokers said profit-taking continued to hit some of the banks and flour milling companies -- two of the sectors which rode highest in the bull run of January and February. Cements tended upwards, however, despite concern about the long-term implications of a rush to invest in new cement plants. Helwan Portland Cement, which reported healthy profits growth this week, closed 1.00 pound up at 80.00 and Egyptian Tora Portland Cement gained 1.50 to end the day at 95.50, the CMA said. Mohamed Hossny of brokers Triple A said comments earlier this month by National Bank of Egypt chairman Mahmoud Abdel-Aziz were still depressing sentiment in the banking sector. National Societe Generale Bank, one of the stars of the bull run, crashed five percent, the maximum allowed in any one trading session, ending 55.75 down at 1059.25 pounds. Misr International Bank, despite preparations for a global depositary receipt (GDR) issue, shed 21.00 to 771.00. The milling sector was mostly down too, led by West and Central Delta Flour Mills and East Delta Flour Mills, respectively 5.25 and 4.16 pounds lower at the close. Broker Teymour Abou el-Kheir of Intercapital said he thought the overall market had turned the corner and some prices were beginning to look cheap again. &quot;That's enough correction. I expect the market to start rising... Now some of the banks are attractive,&quot; he said. Hossny said company results for the first half of the 1996/7 financial year (July-December) should support prices. Several key companies have reported sharp rises in profits. &quot;The results are certainly keeping our spirits up,&quot; He said. The index for openly traded firms rose to 651.57 from 648.31 points on Tuesday and the index for rarely traded &quot;closed&quot; firms fell to 264.17 from 265.25 points.

E12,E21,E212,ECAT	 Brazil's total public sector deficit could stabilize at around 35 or 36 percent of its gross domestic product, Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro Malan said here Sunday. &quot;We think that this (debt) could be stabilized at around 35 or 36 percent of GDP, as long as you manage to produce a primary surplus in the consolidated public sector budget of around 1.5 to two percent of GDP, and it is our intention to do so&quot;, he told an audience of international bankers.   Malan, speaking at a conference organized by the Institute of International Finance, said that on July 31 Brazil's total public sector debt stood at 34.7 percent of GDP, up from 28 percent of GDP two years earlier. He attributed the increase largely to one-shot events like the giant capitalization of state-owned Banco do Brasil and the recognition of previously unacknowledged debts. &quot;It's becoming a more reliable figure and it is not high by international standards,&quot; he added.&quot;I don't know if there are Italians, Belgians, or Greeks here, but in their countries it is well over 100 percent of GDP&quot;.   Malan, who is here for the annual IMF/World Bank meeting, said the administration of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was working hard to carry out structural reforms, and will continue to do so until his term expires on December 31, 1998. He argued that Cardoso clearly had strong popular support but would have to grapple with Congress to win approval for his plans, just like any other democratic leader in the world. Recounting Brazil's success in fighting inflation, which was in four digits earlier this decade, Malan said that he expected inflation to end between 11 and 12 percent this year.   He forecast that Brazil's inflation rate would dip to a single digit in 1997 for the first time since 1957. Regarding GDP growth, which slowed from 4.2 percent last year to about three percent this year. Malan said that he expected an upswing sparked in the current half year to lead to 4.5 percent growth in 1997 and a similar performance in 1998. For the six-year period between 1993 and 1998 Brazil's GDP will post growth of 30 percent in real terms, he added. &quot;When people ask: 'Well, couldn't do better, haven't we done better in the past?' I say yes, we could and we will. We are creating the conditions for higher sustainable growth over time,&quot; he argued. -- Peter Bate (202) 898-8306
M12,MCAT	 U.S. mortgage-backed securities were barely changed and yield spreads were nearly unchanged late in the day as traders marked time before Federal Reserve policymakers meet on Tuesday, dealers said. A trader at a major U.S. bank described mortgage activity as &quot;extremely quiet.&quot; The trader said &quot;I think people are on the sidelines waiting for tomorrow.&quot; Ginnie Mae 30-year 7.5 percent pass-throughs were flat at 99-9/32 to yield 100 basis points over the 10-year Treasury note.   Comparable Fannie Mae issues were off 1/32 at 99-9/32, while Freddie Macs were 1/32 higher at 99-16/32. The 10-year Treasury note was down 2/32 at 6.71 percent. A Reuters poll of 39 U.S. primary dealers released on Monday showed 21 expected the Fed to keep interest rates unchanged, but 18 predicted a 25-basis-point hike in the 5.50 percent federal funds rate. Of that 18, three forecasted the Fed would also lift the 5.0 percent discount rate. Should the Federal Reserve tighten credit, Cynthia Rivera, a mortgage research analyst at BZW Securities Inc, said the U.S. Treasury curve may flatten.   If the Treasury curve flattens, typically mortgage spreads widen because there is no arbitrage to create collateralized mortgage obligations, Rivera said. More importantly, Rivera said, because of short-term rates increasing, discounting cash flows off of higher short-term rates could cause mortgage spreads to widen. (( -- Donna Sells, 212-859-1668))

GCAT,GSPO	 Flanker Philippe Benetton will miss France's Five Nations' championship match against Wales on February 15 after breaking his jaw in club match on Sunday. Benetton, who will be out of action for four to six weeks, was carried off the pitch in the second half of a match between his club Agen and Perigueux. He also lost a tooth in the incident. France are already without scrum-half Fabien Galthie, who has had a knee operation and will be out for a month, as well as injured fly-half Alain Penaud and suspended prop Franck Tournaire for the Wales match.
C24,C31,CCAT	 A likely extension of capacity cuts on Pacific Intertie power lines through this winter could put upward pressure on prices in the U.S. Northwest electricity market, industry sources said. &quot;We are following the issue closely,&quot; said Pete Forsyth, power contracts manager at Kaiser Aluminum Corp in Portland, Ore. &quot;We are very concerned about anything that has to do with reliability and our reserve commitment.&quot;   Voltage on the intertie lines, which link the Northwest to the Southwest, has been capped at 65 percent of capacity as a precation after a major outage hit the western electricity grid on August 10, leaving millions of people in the dark. The restrictions are expected to remain until studies of how to reliably operate the western grid are complete. The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), which runs the northwest part of the Intertie, has said it hopes to complete its work to assure voltage support before April, when the spring runoff swells reservoirs at BPA's hydroelectric dams.   If the lines cannot be fully used by then, BPA stands to lose millions of dollars in foregone hydroelectricity sales. Though the spring target is still in question, most market participants are resolved to capacity restrictions remaining in place through the winter, when northbound power transmissions typically surpass southbound volumes. Capacity on the Intertie system's 4,800 MW AC line is now limited to 3,200 MW flowing south and 3,675 MW flowing north. The 3,200 MW DC intertie is capped at 2,000 to 2,400 MW.   The Northwest, which relies heavily on electricity for heating, sees peak demand in the winter, the opposite of the Southwest, which sees demand peak for summer air conditioning. Furthermore, Northwest hydropower generation can vary widely during the winter depending on the weather. &quot;(The situation) is not so bad this year. There is a lot of water in the reservoirs,&quot; said one industry source. But he warned a lengthy cold spell could make things tough up north. If it is severely cold, streams and reservoirs could slow or freeze, hampering power generation at the dams.   In the past, the Northwest has relied on power imports from the south to get through cold, peak demand days. Without that back-up, emergency measures might have to be taken, sources said. These could range from steps to assure voltage support for individual transmission lines to interrupting power deliveries to some large industrial users. Kaiser's Forsyth noted that Kaiser's power supplies, along with those to BPA's other direct service industrial customers, or &quot;DSIs&quot;, have been interrupted in the past. During a drought in the early 1990s, the top 25 percent of DSI's loads were cut when hydropower supplies fell short.   Under new long-term contracts, in place since October, most DSIs managed to reduce their reliance on BPA. But they are still subject to various short-term reserve commitments tied to imports on the intertie lines. &quot;Anytime you have restrictions on the intertie that last through the winter it makes me nervous,&quot; said Doug Faulkner at DSI Inc, a firm representing BPA's big industrial customers. While pointing out that this winter's power supplies seem adequate given the current high reservoir levels, he said the total DSI load of around 2,500 MW potentially could be interrupted under BPA's capacity reserve commitments.   Faulkner also said he had no idea whether any DSIs had specific contracts from Southwest utilities or marketers that might be affected by the intertie constraints. --D Beasley, Los Angeles bureau + 1 213 955 6761

M14,M141,MCAT	 Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) soy and corn contracts extended sharp overnight losses in Asian trade on Thursday, with soybeans seen dipping further before consolidating and corn battered by Chinese sales, traders said. &quot;It appears that the Chicago grain futures markets have entered a phase of technical correction, pressured by a collapse in soybeans and reports that China is poised to sell more corn,&quot; said Nobufumi Iimori, manager of the commodities investment division of Japan's Nihon Unicom Corporation.   The CBOT May soybean futures contract was indicated at $8.25 a bushel at 1030 GMT in Asia on Thursday, down 3-1/2 cents from Chicago's open outcry close on the exchange's after-hours Project A trading system. CBOT May corn futures were down 1-1/2 cents a bushel at $2.92-1/2 on Project A. &quot;Market players sold contracts on CBOT Project A trading in anticipation of further losses in the Chicago market on Thursday,&quot; one Tokyo trader said.   Taiwanese oilseeds buyers said they now believe Chicago soybean futures will enter a consolidation period, but said they expected the contract's recent bull run to resume in the long-term. &quot;Soybeans must consolidate after the sharp rise and fall in recent trading days,&quot; said one buyer in Taipei. The buyers said the soybean market was fundamentally strong on the back of low stocks in the United States, despite the report on Wednesday that a trader had sold a cargo of Brazilian soybeans to the U.S. which triggered the futures sell-off, but they added they expected Chicago prices to remain volatile.   They added that U.S. funds were unlikely to return to buy large long soybean positions after the CBOT sell-off. Taiwan analysts said soybean technical indicators were showing some signs of a downturn, but that the trend was not yet clear. &quot;For the near-term, the Chicago market may ease on a technical correction. But the correction might be short-lived,&quot; one said. East Asian traders were more bearish on the prospects for corn prices following China's return to the international market as a major seller.   &quot;CBOT corn can't have a major rally when China is still selling,&quot; a Taiwan trader said, adding that local corn buyers were happy with current prices and are placing tenders to lock them in. All corn futures on the Tokyo Grain Exchange plunged by the 500-yen per tonne daily limit on Thursday, battered by the losses in the Chicago market. In South Korea, the National Livestock Cooperatives Federation (NLCF) said it bought 75,000 tonnes of Chinese corn on Thursday through tenders.   An NLCF source said it passed on other tenders for 137,500 tonnes of corn and 105,000 tonnes of feed wheat due to high offer prices. The source said the cooperative had originally aimed to buy 160,000 tonnes of Chinese corn and 52,500 tonnes of Argentine corn. Since January, South Korean buyers have bought an estimated 885,500 tonnes of Chinese corn. One South Korean trader said foreign suppliers could switch previous corn sales from other origins to Chinese corn to take advantage of lower prices and faster shipment times.   &quot;If they hedged their corn physical sales through futures markets, they can get some profit by delivering Chinese corn instead of U.S. corn,&quot; he said. Supplier Tradigrain is to deliver 50,000 tonnes of corn from China -- Tradi had originally sold the corn to the Korea Feedgrain Purchase Committee specifying worldwide origins for arrival by April 30. South Korea has bought an estimated 1.67 million tonnes (33 50,000-tonne cargoes) of corn from all origins since early last summer, for arrival between April to August this year.   Traders said some of these purchases, especially for arrival between April and May, may now be sourced from China to take advantage of lower prices. But they added that most of the shipments will still be sourced from Argentina, whose export season runs from June to August. The traders said about eight 50,000-tonne cargoes of corn are scheduled to arrive in South Korea in April and May.

E21,E211,ECAT	 Pakistan's Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said on Friday that the nation's budget deficit was expected to be at 5.2 to 5.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) against a 4.0 percent target in 1996/97, ending on June 30. Aziz also told Reuters Financial Television that he hoped for single-digit inflation next year. He was speaking from Islamabad in a telephone interview with a Reuters reporter in Tokyo.   Asked about the budget deficit projection for the current fiscal year, ending June 30, he said: &quot;The deficit last year was 6.3 percent of GDP and the target (this year) was to bring it down to four percent and very major efforts were made to reach that target. &quot;Unfortunately...now we estimate it will be somewhat higher than five percent; 5.2, 5.3 (percent),&quot; he said. Regarding inflation, Aziz said he believes increases in industrial production and a drop in import tariffs will help improve the balance of payments and consumer prices. &quot;I do hope next year this phase of having double-digit inflation for four years running will be behind us and we will go to single-digit inflation,&quot; he said.   Asked whether a devaluation of the rupee was on the cards, Aziz said the rupee had fallen in value over the past few years in part because of sluggish exports. Once tariffs were reduced, allowing exporters to buy raw materials at internationally competitive prices, exports should grow which, in turn, should help the rupee, he said. The second factor affecting the currency would be the budget deficit. Although the 5.2 to 5.3 percent of GDP estimate was above the government's original target, it was an improvement, he said. &quot;With those two factors we hope to maintain a more stable currency,&quot; he said.   In the short term, Pakistan can use cash from debt retirement schemes to reduce its trade gap, as previously announced, he said. But he added: &quot;The long-run solution to our economic problems lies in massive export-led growth.&quot;

C17,C34,CCAT,G15,G157,GCAT	 The European Commission is investigating allegations that European producers of special steel are operating a price-fixing cartel, steel industry and legal sources said on Friday. Under investigation is the practice of adding to the price of special steel products an &quot;alloy charge&quot; to compensate for erratic movements in the price of nickel and chrome, which are used in the making of stainless steel. The Commission had no immediate comment, but an industry source said a probe had started less than a year ago following complaints from users of special steel. Such users include the automobile, building and machinery sectors. A Brussels-based antitrust lawyer confirmed the probe and said that the Commission had launched dawn raids at the premises of a number of companies. He would not elaborate. Cracking down on illegal cartels is one of the Commission's most difficult tasks because companies involved keep the matter closely held. The steel sector has been a Commission target before. In February 1994 the Commission fined 16 European companies a total 100 million European currency units ($120 million) for fixing the price and sharing the market for steel beams. In the present case, however, the practice of fixing alloy charges is hardly secret and has been in place practically since the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in the early 1950s. The ECSC is one of the EU's founding institutions, &quot;The practice has existed for 50 years&quot;, the source said. A rise in alloy charges following a higher demand for nickel and chrome some 18 months ago appears to have triggered the complaints. The industry source denied that producers were in a position to dictate the rules saying special steel users were powerful enough to influence prices on their own. The most important companies in the special steel producing sector include Germany's Thyssen and Krupp, Usinor Sacilor's unit Ugine, Sweden's Avesta Sheffield, British Steel and Acciai Speciali Terni SpA which is controlled by Krupp. Outside the steel industry the Commission in 1994 also imposed fines totalling a record 248 million European currency units (Ecus) on 42 European cement producers and associations found guilty of operating a market sharing agreement. Last July the Commission announced that it would reduce or drop fines for companies that would help it to bust cartels.

Forecasts have been revised up to a median of 0.5 percent quarterly growth from 0.3 percent earlier this month, after the stronger than expected company profits data on Thursday. Capex and inventories data will see these forecasts fine-tuned further, but they suggest a reasonable base for growth through 1997, economists said.  While the profits data was revised up for a number of previous quarters, economists were reluctant to say it meant historical GDP data would also be upwardly revised because the profits data does not flow through fully to GDP and there may be some downward revisions to other GDP components which could cancel the stronger profits data. ----------------------------------------------------------------     Capex   Car Reg.

But economists said it had been so strong previously that some moderate numbers could be expected. As well, attention is likely to be focused on the forward estimates for clues as to how investment is expected to perform over the remainder of the 1996/97 year. Along with inventory data, it remains one of the last partial indicators of fourth quarter GDP to be released.  The WAGES data will be important because it provides a public/private sector breakdown, as weel as industry data. The preliminary data was boosted by a large increase in female earnings, which economists said suggested public sector wages may have grown most in the quarter. This is seen as less of a concern than private sector wages growth, which is seen as potentially more inflationary. NEW MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS are not expected to attract too much attention, especially coming on the Friday before one of the busiest data weeks in a while.  -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
GCAT,GPOL,GVIO	 Talks between President Sali Berisha and Albania's opposition parties on ending an armed rebellion in the south remained deadlocked on Sunday as a government ceasefire ran out. Opposition politicians said Berisha met members of his own Democratic Party and 10 other groupings for eight hours, long into Saturday night, pressed by two European mediation missions seeking an end to violence. The talks were likely to be resumed on Sunday. The politicians said the discussions had reached broad agreement on holding fresh elections within two to three months. But they ran into trouble over Berisha's insistence that he would not allow the Socialists, heirs to Albania's communist party, into an interim government. &quot;We need a government made up of all parties which will win the confidence of those people now in rebellion,&quot; Socialist Party leader Rexhep Mejdani told Reuters. &quot;But Berisha said there was no place in any government for the Socialists.&quot; Berisha has made no public statements for several days. But in an interview printed in the Democratic Party daily Rilindja Demokratike, the only daily printed under emergency regulations in effect for a week, his top adviser Genc Pollo dismissed any cooperation with the Socialists. &quot;I personally consider it quite dangerous to accept in government a political party which leads an armed rvolution,&quot; Pollo said. &quot;This offers it a chance to clean its hands.&quot; Socialist leader Fatos Nano is currently in jail after being convicted of corruption. The opposition says he is a political prisoner. Former Austrian leader Franz Vranitzky held two meetings on Saturday with Berisha as part of efforts by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to end the conflict, which has killed at least 20 people in the past week. A European Union delegation held similar talks last week. Some opposition politicians suggested that Berisha was giving some ground in response to outside mediation efforts. &quot;I am more optimistic after (Saturday's) talks,&quot; Paskal Milo of the Social Democratic party told Reuters. &quot;Berisha is in a desperate situation. He has very little room for manoeuvre.&quot; Opposition parties had objected to Berisha's original proposal to hold elections within 45 days, saying emergency rules and the rebellion in the south made it impossible to hold a campaign.

E12,E121,ECAT	 German M3 money supply growth, the key indicator for Bundesbank monetary policy, is likely to have slowed down enough in May to hit the bank's 1997 target corridor of 3.5 to 6.5 percent, analysts said. Forecasts for annualised, seasonally-adjusted M3 growth in May average about 6.2 percent from the fourth quarter of 1996, compared with 6.7 percent growth in April, according to a Reuter poll of economists. Forecasts ranged from 6.0 to 6.5 percent. Analysts said the slowdown was explained by weak growth in lending to the private and public sectors. But the data, expected to be released later this week or early next, will not increase the chances for a cut in Bundesbank interest rates, analysts said. &quot;In the current environment of a modest economic upswing, there is no need for an interest rate cut,&quot; said Manuela Preuschl, an economist at Deutsche Bank Research who estimates M3 growth slowed to between 6.0 and 6.5 percent in May. The Bundesbank's main money market rate, the securities repurchase or &quot;repo&quot; rate, has been fixed at three percent since last August. The bank last cut its discount and Lombard rates in April 1996, to 2.50 percent and 4.50 percent respectively. Economists said investment in bonds -- a process known as money capital formation which tends to weaken M3 growth by siphoning funds out of short-term bank accounts -- was likely to have remained modest in May and did not have a dampening impact on the money supply. But public borrowing in May is likely to have been moderate because government coffers received 8.83 billion marks in April from the Bundesbank's 1996 profit, economists said. Bundesbank officials have recently fanned hopes that M3 will hit the Bundesbank's target, with council member Ernst Welteke saying on Tuesday he was confident M3 would soon be in the corridor. But they have also said that they see no need for a change in interest rates upward or downward in the foreseeable future. M3 comprises cash in circulation, time, sight and short-term savings deposits. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525

M12,MCAT	 Ecuador Bradys were in demand on Monday with investors encouraged by the appointment of Rosalia Arteaga as interim president and many of them covering short positions after the weekend. Russia opened higher after the International Monetary Fund handed over almost $650 million of its $10 billion three-year loan, and a debt rescheduling agreement between Russia and the United States was signed. &quot;The big mover today is Ecuador,&quot; said Brigitte Standing of Bank America in London. &quot;There was a mad scramble for it this morning and I've only seen buyers,&quot; she added. &quot;A lot of people went into the weekend short and the short-covering is now pushing (the market) up.&quot; Ecuador PDIs  ECPDI=RR rose as high as 61-3/8, up close to two points from Friday's close. Standing said the price could go up to the 66 level where they were at the beginning of last week, with the down-side limited for the time being. &quot;I think it's a fantastic opportunity to get back in,&quot; she added. The Brady market's relentless rise of this year looks set to continue unless the U.S. raises interest rates and investors start taking profits, one dealer said. Russian debt was a bit stronger and a dealer said the main reason for this was that the bad news from Russia had run out. He said Russia was near closing a deal with the London Club and &quot;people are feeling a bit better about the deal coming off&quot;. Another trader said the market had opened firmer with some buying on the IMF news, though there was profit-taking later. Russian Brady prices were lagging the market and have upside potential, a dealer said. Bulgarian debt was about 1/2 point off and one dealer said this was a reaction to comments by a member of the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) coalition, who dismissed the need for a currency board to help Bulgaria out of financial crisis. Morgan Stanley said it was revising its medium-term outlook on Bulgaria to overweight from neutral and said Bulgarian Brady prices have at least five points of upside over the next two months. The market overall was 1/4 of a percentage point stronger, according to the J.P. Morgan Brady index. -- Caroline Smith, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7770 (fax +44 171 583 7239)

E11,E21,E212,E41,E411,ECAT,GCAT,GJOB	 Germany's public sector borrowing may reach 3.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) this year because of the country's record unemployment level, the BBC said on Monday. &quot;The BBC has learned that the record number of jobless (in Germany) is officially expected to push public sector borrowing to 3.5 percent of GDP,&quot; a BBC television report said. It said this was casting fresh doubts on whether Germany would be able to meet the criteria for taking part in European economic and monetary union in 1999. One of the criteria is that public sector borrowing -- the budget deficit -- should not exceed 3.0 percent of GDP in 1997. &quot;Unemployment figures appear to be more of a threat to the government's budget calculations than originally thought,&quot; the BBC report said. Germany's unemployment rate climbed to 12.2 percent, or 4.66 million people, in January, its highest level since 1933. Last year, when unemployment was significantly lower, Germany had a deficit to GDP ratio of 3.6 percent, official figures showed.
E51,E512,ECAT	 South Korea has opened a trade and investment promotion agency in Zimbabwe aimed at helping boost trade between the two countries. Oliver Manyau, a spokesman for the Harare-based centre, told reporters that a Korean trade mission would be visiting Zimbabwe in May as part of this effort. &quot;We are currently working on a number of joint ventures which are still in the preliminary stages. &quot;There is a lot of interest being generated in the textile industry and we are looking at modalities of resuscitating liquidated companies,&quot; he said. South Korean investors were also interested in a number of sectors, inluding paper and packaging, food processing, machinery, rubber, plastic and car batteries manufacturing and in trading auto parts, medical and surgical instruments and alarm systems, he said. Trade between the two countries -- which is heavily in favour of South Korea -- is currently valued at Z$300 million (U.S.$27.4 million) a year. South Korea exports mainly cars, electronic gadgets and household electronic equipment to Zimbabwe while the southern African state exports asbestos, granite stone and timber. Car manufacturers Hyundai and Daewoo are among a couple of South Korean companies that have opened up marketing points in Zimbabwe in the last five years. $1=10.95 ---Cris Chinaka, Harare Newsroom: +263-4 72 52 27/8/9.
M11,MCAT	 U.S. shares trading in London were becalmed on Tuesday, with trade thin and prices showing no clear trend, dealers said. Most of the day's muted activity was centred on high-tech stocks, they said, amid the official release of new products from International Business Machines Corp (IBM) and Sun Microsystems Inc. &quot;There's virtually no corporate news around and there is very little on the calendar, so it has been a very quiet morning,&quot; one dealer said.   By 1120 GMT, March S&amp;P 500 futures were 0.60 points up at 815.60, while the March long bond contract was 5/32 higher at 11-25/32. IBM shares climbed $1/8 to $146-1/8 and Sun Micro gained $3/8 to $31-5/8. Elsewhere in the high-tech sector, Digital Equipment Corp fell $1/8 to $32 and Hewlett-Packard Co fell $1/4 to $56-1/4. U.S. retail sales data is due on Thursday and producer prices figures are released on Friday. Dealers said strong numbers would raise expectations of a U.S. rate rise as early as March 25. -- London newsroom +44 171 542 4026
M13,M132,MCAT	 Implied volatilities for dollar/yen options firmed in relatively thin U.S. business as the spot dollar dipped below 114 yen, traders said. &quot;Vols are bid on all the spot moves after the numbers came out,&quot; said a U.S. bank trader in New York, referring to choppy trading after a weaker than expected June U.S. jobs report. June non-farm payrolls rose 217,000 against an average estimate of a 222,000 gain and May's 166,000 rise. The trader said out-of-the-money yen calls remained steeply priced over equivalent yen puts, keeping risk reversals sharply skewed.   One-month dollar/yen implied volatility stood at 10.4/10.6 percent at U.S. midday, up half a point from late Wednesday levels. The curve was mostly flat, with some inversion in the back end as one-year was little changed at 10.2/10.4 percent. One-month 25-delta risk reversal widened back out to 2.4/2.7 point, just short of a 2.75 high earlier in the week. Traders noted that dollar/yen and sterling/dollar volatilities were bid as risk perception had centered on the dollar's downside. By contrast, dollar/mark volatilities were subdued as the greenback slipped after touching a fresh 40-month high of 1.7566 marks.   One-month cable rose to 8.1/8.4 percent from Wednesday's 7.4/7.7, and one-month dollar/mark shed more than a quarter point to 8.0/8.3 percent. One-month sterling/mark rose to 9.8/10.1 percent from 9.2/9.6. A lack of a breakout-type behavior in spot or aggressive bids in volatilities was making dollar/mark's rally look tentative, even though the greenback has ground up to new highs each day this week, some market-watchers said. &quot;It's beginning to look like a (broadly) weaker dollar may become a little bit more realistic,&quot; Alan Revercomb, options strategist at I.D.E.A. Inc.   &quot;If we do get a dollar/mark breakdown here, it starts to be perceived as an overall dollar bear move,&quot; he said. &quot;That's probably when you get volatilities to spark back to life.&quot; The one-month correlation of spot dollar/mark and dollar/yen was starting to return to normal levels in the 0.6-0.8 area after being unusually low in the past few months, he said. The three-month correlation was still near zero. Revercomb said a broad dollar decline would probably be led by a breakout in dollar/yen, whose daily chart was forming a triangle-like pattern that was approaching its apex. He saw the 113.20-yen area as a critical level near term.   However, should the dollar hold its recent ranges next week, resolution of the market's current abnormalities could come in the form of a stagnation, traders said. Dollar/yen's stubborn skew in risk reversals might relent if the dollar does not threaten the lower end of recent ranges, Revercomb noted. He said dealers' short-gamma exposures in the downside strikes would go away as one-month options bought heavily in early June gradually expired. Still, those short positions would start biting and destabilize the market if the dollar fell, making the yen calls gamma-rich at-the-money short-dated options. -- Shin Kishima/Chicago Derivatives Desk ((312-408-8750)) E-mail: derivatives@reuters.com

E21,E211,ECAT,GCAT,GPOL	 The New York State Senate adjourned a special year-end session early Wednesday morning without approving a tax extension for New York City, which was worth $450 million a year, the New York Times reproted. It was not clear what killed the measure, which seemed close to being passed Tuesday morning, when Gov. George Pataki, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver (D-Manhattan) and the Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno (R-Troy) said there was an agreement to extend it for two years. John McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate Republican Leader said the city had asked the house not do the bill, but a city official, who declined to be named, denied that, the New York Times said. And Silver told the paper that &quot;the Senate walked out on it, apparently.&quot; The 12.5 percent personal income tax surcharge could be imposed retroactively next year, but city officials said they feared it would become a bargaining chip in unrelated legislative battles. The Senate also declined to act on a proposal to raise the city's debt ceiling, and to extend a business tax that provices about 10 percent of the day-to-day operating budget of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which expires at year-end, the paper said. --U.S. Municipal Desk, 212-859-1650
C21,C24,CCAT	 China plans to set up manufacturing centres to build electric-powered vehicles, the China Daily said on Monday. The cabinet's State Science and Technology Commission has listed the development of electric vehicles as one of the key scientific and technological engineering projects of its five-year plan from 1996 to 2000, the newspaper said. It said the expected annual capacity would be 3,000 to 5,000 vehicles, though it did not say who would be the expected users. The newspaper also did not say where the manufacturing centres would be based, when production would start or how much would be invested. &quot;The development of electric and substitute-fuel vehicles is of strategic importance to China's national economy,&quot; Xu Guanhua, vice-minister of the commission, was quoted as saying. &quot;It is in line with China's energy mix and the growing concern with environmental problems,&quot; he said. The newspaper gave no further details. Last week, the Xinhua news agency said China's first solar-powered car had passed appraisal by the commission and the Ministry of Internal Trade.
C17,C171,C18,C183,CCAT	 Uncertainty is clouding the planned multi-billion dollar public offerings of shares in Australia's two main telecommunications companies. The offers -- a one-third stake in state-owned Telstra Corp and a major issue of new and existing shares in rival Optus Communications Pty Ltd -- are expected to raise a total of A$10 billion (US$7.5 billion) or more by end-1997. But the size and timing of the floats are now seen to be in doubt, as both carriers work feverishly to clear obstacles from their path to the market. The Telstra offer, said to be worth at least A$8 billion alone, is more likely to be made in early 1998 rather than the current schedule of November, industry analysts said on Monday. Optus' biggest shareholder, Mayne Nickless Ltd, which is eager to sell its 24.9 percent stake, said last week that the timing of the Optus float was now unclear. Optus has yet to unveil its float plans, but proceeds have been estimated at up to A$1.5 billion. Investors see the biggest obstacle as the heavy losses both carriers are suffering at the hands of Australia's fledgling pay-television industry, the analysts said. Telstra and Optus are investing jointly over A$7 billion rolling out duplicate broad-band cable networks in the country's major cities. Pay-TV, the first product delivered via the new cable, has proven to be a big loss-maker for Telstra and Optus. &quot;It's business suicide to set up pay-TV as it's being set up in Australia,&quot; said analyst Andrew Butterell, of brokerage ANZ McCaughan. &quot;It doesn't make sense.&quot; The red ink so far spilt on the pay-TV battle ground has concentrated the minds of senior management at Telstra and, in the case of Optus, literally shaken it up. The company's chief executive and chairman resigned last week. New chief executive Peter Howell-Davies, who ran Mercury Communications for London's Cable and Wireless group, said his first task would be to sort out the pay-TV business. Teltsra and Optus have been trying for months to reach a truce in the cable war and strike a cable-sharing deal. Howell-Davies' predecessor, Ziggy Switkowski, was not moving with enough urgency on this front, industry analysts speculated. Optus is owned 24.9 percent by Mayne, 24.5 percent each by Cable and Wireless and BellSouth Corp of the United States. The rest is owned by Australian institutions. An Optus source suggested Optus could haul itself out of the quicksand of pay-TV and list on the share market in six months. To do this, it could sell the pay-TV business to an entertainment firm, such as one of the broadcast TV networks, but retain ownership of the cable network, the source said. The source also said it was likely Optus would write off some of the value of its cable network before listing. &quot;I'm sure that the whole pay-TV industry, from the points of view of Optus and Telstra, will be sorted out, and there will probably be write-offs and that sort of stuff,&quot; he said. &quot;But I think if you look six months down the track, you will be looking at the purity of telecommunications,&quot; he said. &quot;I think the question is whether pay-TV is a natural business of a telecommunications company, and the answer is no,&quot; he added. But Optus and Telstra have other, smaller clouds hanging over their floats. Optus has struggled to make a success of its local telephony service. Telstra is being sued for about A$350 million by two big customers over billing disputes and is said to face an uncertain liability after a defence contact turned sour. Last week, a defence ministry document came to light which quoted an investment bank as saying Telstra's market value could be slashed by A$1.2 billion, under a worst-case scenario, if Telstra failed to deliver on a contract to build a huge radar. But analysts believe these issues may not make much of a dent in Telstra's market value, and the long-term prospects for both businesses are sound. The real short-term concern for both floats is the pay-TV business, they said. &quot;The long-term outlook for the industry, once these difficulties are resolved, is quite attractive,&quot; said analyst Andrew Mulholland, of brokerage Prudential-Bache Securities.

C13,CCAT,E12,ECAT	 Estonia's central bank on Wednesday said that it is to raise the capital adequacy ratios of commercial banks. Officials have expressed concern over the rapid pace of bank lending in Estonia, which grew by 70 percent in 1996 compared with expected economic growth of around four to five percent. The central bank said capital adequacy ratios would rise on October 1 from eight to 10 percent and it would also change the way that the ratios were calculated. &quot;Although the main target is to decrease structural differences, they will also have a tightening effect on banks' expansion plans,&quot; the central bank said. &quot;The Bank of Estonia sees the requirements to secure the banking sector in the context of the goverment's plans to strengthen overall fiscal discipline,&quot; it added. The raising of capital adequacy ratios is part of Estonia's latest agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for standby credits. Estonia has also introduced laws to tighten rules for local government borrowing as it must cut the public sector deficit from 1.5 percent of GDP in 1996 to 0.5 percent this year. The central government budget is balanced. IMF Estonia and Latvia resident representative Dimitri Demekas welcomed the rise in capital adequacy ratios. &quot;We are happy and this (a rise in the ratios) is part of the programme that we agreed with Estonia,&quot; Demekas said. &quot;It may have an small curbing effect on the rate of growth of credit but at the same time it will boost confidence in the Estonian banking system,&quot; Demekas added. &quot;I do not expect a dampening of economic growth,&quot; he added. -- Tallinn Newsroom +372 630 8400
C31,CCAT	 CIDCO Inc said the strong direct marketing programs undertaken with the telephone operating companies in the first quarter may not be sustainable through 1997. Strong demand from these programs contributed to first quarter sales' performance as adjunct Caller-ID units accounted for 96 percent of total sales. These programs incur higher sales and marketing expenses, which rose to $20.4 million in the quarter, but declined as a percentage of sales from the fourth quarter. CIDCO is forming strategies to make its revenues more predictable by 1998 and to develop businesses beyond adjunct products.
C12,C13,CCAT,GCAT,GCRIM,GHEA,GPOL	 President Bill Clinton on Friday said the U.S. tobacco settlement proposal was a &quot;terrific achievement&quot; but must not be allowed to paralyse the Food and Drug Administration. &quot;It was a terrific achievement,&quot; Clinton said of the negotiated settlement reached a week ago between the tobacco industry and officials from 40 states. &quot;But my preliminary take is that we do not want to paralyse the capacity of the FDA to protect the American people. &quot;That to me is the critical thing,&quot; he said at a White House bill-signing ceremony. Clinton said he would not prejudge the overall agreement, a 68-page document that touches on various aspects of federal policies and powers, pending a detailed White House review over the next 30 days or so. A task force headed by Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala and Clinton domestic policy adviser Bruce Reed has already begun that work, examining regulatory, legal and economic issues, as well as whether the plan would advance the anti-smoking public health agenda. Clinton's comments about the FDA appeared to be his most critical so far about the settlement proposal, under which the industry would curb marketing and advertising practices and pay out $368 billion over 25 years, some of which would go to finance public health and anti-smoking programmes. But Clinton did not reject it outright. &quot;The broad dimensions of it are quite staggering,&quot; he said. &quot;Even in Washington $368 billion is a lot of money.&quot; Under the accord, cigarette makers did agree to recognise FDA jurisdiction over tobacco and nicotine, within certain limits. But leading U.S. public health groups, led by former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and former FDA Commissioner David Kessler, say the actual legal language in the accord would in fact hamper the FDA. They have demanded that Congress make revisions as it considers the legislation that would be required to enact the agreement. Briefing reporters in the White House, Shalala said the task force would try to evaluate the whole proposal to see how it interacted with existing federal regulatory powers and health policy. She said she wanted to find out, precisely, from where the $368 billion will come. &quot;Our goal is to find out whether this proposal will improve public health -- and at what cost,&quot; she said. &quot;Who pays for this proposal? Is it the stockholders? Is it individuals because taxes will go up on cigarettes? Is it the broader taxpayers because some (settlement payments) might be deductible under current laws?&quot; In addition to the White House, several congressional committees will hold hearings on the proposal. The Senate Judiciary Committee held one session this week in which many lawmakers said they saw weak spots in the settlement outline. But they did not threaten to abandon it entirely.

GCAT,GPOL,GVOTE	 Despite the latest opinion poll showing a sharp drop in the Labour Party's lead over the ruling Conservatives, The Times newspaper said on Wednesday leaders of the opposition party do not need to panic. An NOP poll in The Sunday Times said Labour's lead slipped from 23 to 14 points over a fortnight. &quot;There is no evidence yet of a significant change in public attitudes towards the parties. The Tories still have a mountain to climb,&quot; The Times said. It attributed the shift to a comparison between a poll taken after Labour's successful party conference and one taken after the Conservatives' annual meeting. &quot;The key feature of the recent polls is that, despite month-to-month variations and a slow Tory recovery, Labour retains an unprecedentedly large lead for so late in a parliament,&quot; the newspaper added. A general election is due by May 1997 at the latest. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717
M13,M131,MCAT	 UK overnight cash rates firmed to around seven percent as the liquidity shortage was left only partly covered, but trading was quiet and most operators appeared to hold fairly square positions. Bank of England assistance totalled 315 million stg compared with its shortage forecast of 750 million. Overnight cash was quoted at around 7-1/4 7.0 percent in late business, at the top of the day's range. The low point was around 5-5/8 percent. &quot;At the moment I don't think anyone has any real positions either way,&quot; one trader said. &quot;It's still the rollover from the August lull. People are probably pretty square and don't need to sell the bills to square their positions up.&quot; Business was also quiet ahead of Wednesday's UK monetary meeting. A Reuter poll of 20 economists on Monday showed 13 thought interest rates would be left on hold at 5.75 percent while seven expected a cut. But most analysts say the decision is finely balanced. Trading was also subdued in the gilt repo market, with initial business in the 6.0 percent gilts due 1999 at around 4.0 percent, but the stock later moved up to around 5-1/4. This is well above the exceptionally low levels of one to three percent seen last week. Overnight general collateral (GC) was also tight in line with the cash market, with the highs around 7.0 percent. &quot;Things livened up towards the end, but it was pretty quiet overall,&quot; a repo trader said. One-month GC was barely changed at 5.68 64 compared with 5.67 63 percent on Monday afternoon. -- Richard Murphy, London Newsroom 44 171 542 2774

GCAT,GSPO	 Haile Gebrselassie set a two miles world best of eight minutes 1.08 seconds at an international meeting on Saturday but missed out on a $1 million dollar payout. Ethiopian Gebrselassie took nearly two-and-a-half seconds off the mark of 8:03.54 set by Daniel Komen of Kenya in July last year. Despite going into new territory for the event, Gebrselassie left the Fanny Blankers Koen Stadium without a cent for his efforts. &quot;We always said it would be a million dollars or nothing,&quot; said Jos Hermans, the meeting organiser and ironically Gebrselassie's agent. A $1 million dollar cheque was on offer if any runner in the race, built up as a head-to-head clash between Gebrselassie and Noureddine Morceli of Algeria, broke the eight-minute barrier. &quot;There was no appearance money,&quot; confirmed Hermans. Nevertheless Gebrselassie was far from downcast at the outcome. &quot;I actually feel more than a million dollars. The money is not that important. I can get it in the future,&quot; he said. Gebrselassie suggested that the gusting wind and poor pacemaking was responsible for his inability to go under eight minutes. &quot;I do not know exactly how much time the wind cost me but maybe two, three or four seconds. Also the pacemaking at the start was a little slow.&quot; Instead of running all the way to the bank, Gebrselassie will now set his sights on regaining the world record over 10,000 metres. He plans an assault on the time of 26 minutes 38.08 seconds, recorded by Salah Hissou last August, at the Oslo Grand Prix meeting on July 4. &quot;Now I've got my two miles record back I want the 10,000 metres,&quot; said Gebrselassie. Philip Mosima of Kenya was second in the two-mile race in 8:14.45 and Mohammed Mourit of Belgium third in 8:14.88. Morceli dropped out at the start of the final lap, clutching his left thigh and later complained of having suffered badly from jet lag after his return from high altitude training in the United States four days ago. The highlight of the remainder of the meeting was the 1,500 metres in which Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj ran 3:29.51, the fastest time in the world this year. Assefa Mezgebu of Ethiopia, a training partner of Gebrselassie, showed shades of his compatriot's ability by winning the 10,000 metres in 27:25.01. He took nearly 40 seconds off his previous best for the distance. Kim Batten of the United States, the world champion and holder of the world best in the women's 400 metres hurdles, won her specialist event in 54.41. She was first to rise from the gun and finished well clear of the opposition. Lydia Cheromei of Kenya was an equally impressive winner of the women's 3,000 metres. The former world junior cross country champion clocked 8:38.86, the fastest time in the world this year.

The company's turnover surged to about 1.3 billion tolars from 500 million in the previous year, he said.

M14,MCAT	 Dirty tanker rates were little changed across the board on Thursday with insufficient activity to move the market, brokers said. &quot;The market is in a holding pattern. There is activity out there but not enough to get things on the boil,&quot; said a broker specialising in the Middle East very large crude carrier (VLCC) market. Another broker said the West Africa market was similar. &quot;There's quite a lot of fixing but the market isn't going anywhere.&quot; The weekly newsletter Oil Movements said OPEC chartering was &quot;slipping into a seasonal trough.&quot; &quot;Year on year, the volume change is still sizeable -- up 4.5 million b/d (barrels per day) in the latest four weeks -- but directionally the market is back on track, after the erratic swings of the winter season.&quot; &quot;Volume turned down on all the key long haul routes and most long haul freight rate indicators are heading the same way. Because chartering is a leading indicator, the impact on volume is some way down the road,&quot; Oil Movements said. Meanwhile, Mideast/Japan, Mideast/Singapore and Mideast/west 250,000 tonne VLCC rates were steady at W62.5/W65, W60/62.5 and W52.5 respectively. West Africa/U.S. VLCCs were also little changed at W72.5, with 130,000 tonne vessels at W97.5. The Mediterranean fuel oil market was one of the few sectors to move significantly, with 25,000 tonne cargoes at W210/215, up five to 10 points after 12 vessels had been fixed in the last couple of days, an Italian broker said. &quot;A day or two ago people were scared that there was little demand and rates would come down but now there are no prompt ships. Rates look like increasing,&quot; he added. The North Sea and cross-Med markets were featureless, with inter-U.K./cont 80,000 tonne cargoes at W120/125, down some 15 points from before Easter. Cross-Med 80,000 tonne cargoes remained at about W130, while 130,000 tonners were at W95/97.5, brokers said. Caribs/upcoast rates also showed little sign of moving despite a fair level of fixtures. The rate for 70,000 tonne crude cargoes remained at about W230, with 50,000 tonnes of fuel oil at W215. -- London newsroom +44 171 542 4088

C11,C22,C23,CCAT	 International Business Machines Corp and Netscape Communications Corp are expected to announce Wednesday that Netscape is developing a version of the Navigator browser for the next version of OS/2. IBM said it is holding a teleconference to announce a joint software-related agreement with Netscape executives on Tuesday at 1200 noon EDT. An IBM spokesman declined to comment on the details of the announcement. But Tim Sloane, an analyst with the Aberdeen Group, said Netscape is developing a version of its popular Navigator Web browser for IBM's next version of its PC operating system.   &quot;They have also agreed to extend the Navigator product a little bit by adding in some of the voice recognition capabilities that come with OS/2 Warp,&quot; Sloane said. &quot;You can say 'take me to (search engine) Yahoo!',&quot; he explained. Netscape Navigator will replace IBM's current Web browser, called Web Explorer, which has been available on OS/2 Warp since Warp was first introduced as a major revamp of IBM's much-maligned but technically superior operating system, OS/2. IBM said it now has over 14 million users of OS/2. IBM's next version, OS/2 Warp 4, is set for release on September 25, an IBM spokesman said.   OS/2 users will probably be able to download Navigator from the Internet with the new version of OS/2 Warp shortly after it is released in September, analysts said. IBM has rushed out the next release of OS/2 Warp 4, code-named Merlin, in a move to try to fight Microsoft Corp and its widely anticipated Windows NT 4.0, out now. The previous target date had previously been later in the autumn. The move to embrace Navigator is a step in the right direction for IBM, analysts said, but it may not result in a huge number of new users.   &quot;I'm delighted to see IBM break the 'not-invented-here' syndrome and to adopt a technology that clearly has the market share dominance,&quot; Sloane said, referring to Netscape's current dominance of the market for browsers to search the Internet's World Wide Web of computer networks. IBM's user of Navigator will likely please OS/2 users, who currently cannot access all Web sites in their optimal form. &quot;The browser for OS/2 Warp is clearly an inferior product,&quot; said Roy Asfar, assistant managing editor at Computer Reseller News and avid OS/2 user. &quot;Hitting a site designed for Netscape or Microsoft's Explorer is a navigating nightmare if you are browsing with IBM's Web Explorer.&quot;

M12,MCAT	 U.S. Treasuries broke out of a week-long slump and ended higher on Friday, boosted by the Federal Reserve's purchase of coupons and short-covering. The 30-year bond closed at 98-14/32, up 14/32 point, while its yield dipped to 6.75 percent from 6.78 percent. The market had closed lower the first four days of the week. &quot;It was just noise,&quot; said Kevin Sluder, head trader at First Chicago Capital Markets Inc, of the action of the past few days. &quot;It was only a short-term downtrend and not the start of something new.&quot;   Friday's upward move came amid fairly light activity. According to GovPX, volume was around $60 billion. &quot;Friday in the U.S., you can't expect much to happen in the summer,&quot; said Vincent Verterano, head trader at Nomura Securities. &quot;But, there was no selling so that helped.&quot; Treasuries opened the session a bit higher after solid buying during the night in Tokyo and London. Players said that the fall in prices this week brought Treasuries to levels that many accounts -- mainly foreigers -- found enticing. Further gains were made after the Federal Reserve mildly surprised the market and bought longer-dated coupons.   The Fed bought $1.405 billion in Treasuries dated August 15, 2002 to February 15, 2027. The amount was seen as very aggressive and helped wake up the market. Shortly thereafter, dealers covered short positions made earlier in the day on the expectation that Treasuries would fall. Much of the buying took place at the longer end, as traders said numerous accounts extended durations by selling the front end for the long end. Meanwhile, the absence of corporate supply also aided the market, traders said.   Over the past week, about $5.5 billion of investment grade debt was issued. And with much of it longer dated paper, the long end of the Treasury market suffered as it had trouble absorbing the supply. Subsequently, the yield curve steepened by nine basis points this week, with the spread between the two-year note and 30-year bond widening to a month-high of 75 basis points early Friday morning. But the long end rally narrowed the spread to 72 basis points late Friday, and traders expect the spread to flatten back to the mid-60s next week.   The upcoming quarter-end boosted the market on Friday and should lend support again early next week as portfolios attempt to &quot;window dress&quot; their books, players said. Market participants noted that just about all shorts have been covered since few players want to hold short positions heading into next week, which features a Fed meeting and a slew of economic data. May new home sales, the Chicago purchasing managers' survey for June and personal income and spending for May are scheduled for release on Monday.   The National Association of Purchasing Management will relase its June report on Tuesday and employment data for the same month are due on Friday. The Federal Open Market Committee meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, but no rate action is expected. Earlier on Friday, the market shurgged off a 0.1 percent upward revision to first-quarter gross domestic product to a 5.9 percent growth rate. It also snubbed a rise in the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index to a record 104.5 in June from 103.2 in May.   Bills were the lone negative for the market on Friday. The three month Treasury bill rose two basis points to 5.01 percent. Six-month bills were up one basis point to 5.04 percent, and year-bills were down one basis point to 5.32 percent.

GCAT,GPOL,GVOTE	 The conservative anti-abortion Republican who narrowly lost Louisiana's U.S. Senate race to a pro-choice Democrat filed suit Thursday night to overturn try to overturn the election. Attorneys for State Representative Louis &quot;Woody&quot; Jenkins, 49, handed in the suit at the 19th Judicial District Clerk of Court's office at 7:50 p.m. CST. Midnight was the deadline for challenging the election outcome. Under Louisiana law, the trial must be held within four days, and the judge must rule within 24 hours of hearing testimony and evidence. An election challenge in court must prove that voting fraud existed and was widespread enough to change the outcome of the election. Jenkins was defeated by former state Treasurer Mary Landrieu, 40, by just 5,788 votes out of more 1.7 million ballots cast, the closest statewide race in Louisiana history. The suit claims Jenkins' campaign workers have unearthed evidence that some precincts show more votes cast than the number of voters signed in by election officicals. It also claims votes were cast in the name of dead people and that comparisons of some signatures at polling places appear to have been forged. Several hundred volunteers and Jenkins' campaign staff have worked around the clock since Tuesday, when a federal court ordered election officials to open election records to Jenkins's supporters. Campaign manager Tony Perkins said, &quot;The action that we are taking today is about preserving the integrity of our election system. While we have only had time to review a small portion of the documents that (we) have collected, we are confident that there is sufficient evidence to warrant a challenge.&quot; Landrieu is out of the country vacationing with her husband and young son, but attorneys for her campaign waited for copies of the suit. Earlier this week, Landrieu responded to Jenkins' first hints of voting fraud by saying, &quot;Woody has had some trouble dealing with reality throughout this campaign. I'm confident that we won fairly.&quot;
C17,CCAT,E21,E211,ECAT	 The Russian government, tired of pouring money into the troubled agricultural sector, will drastically cut funding to farms next year, a senior Finance Ministry official said on Thursday. Deputy Finance Minister Vasily Kovalyov, quoted by Interfax news agency, said the budget would allot only 2.7 trillion roubles ($470 million) to farms, a fraction of the 16.1 trillion roubles originally budgeted, but later cut, for this year. The projected lower handout is a sign that officials take seriously the task of a realistic budget, as well as a warning to the inefficient and largely unreformed farm sector to seek alternative sources of financing. &quot;We don't want to make empty promises and will strive to fulfil all the financial plans, and to do this, we need a realistic budget,&quot; Kovalyov said. Interfax said only 6.5 trillion roubles, or 40 percent of the 1997 budgeted total, would actually be handed out to farms this year. Russia's reformist cabinet has slashed spending plans, including to the cost-draining agricultural sector, to keep economic reforms on track. Multi-billion dollar handouts to farms comprised a significant chunk of gross domestic product in the Soviet era. Decreased state support may affect agricultural output, since farms cannot afford bank credits and banks are unwilling to lend to a sector in which most enterprises are in a state of collapse. Russian grain output has contracted by 40 percent this decade alone, and around half of the country's food needs are now met by imports.

GCAT,GPOL,GVOTE	 Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's United Front alliance confronts a dangerous foe and a crucial ally in Uttar Pradesh, where state polls this month could hold the key to his future, politicians said on Monday. India's most populous state has announced a three-phased poll in late September and October, putting the United Front in a triangular contest with former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's Congress Party and the rightwing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Deve Gowda formed a minority government in June after Rao promised to support him following inconclusive general elections, and remains beholden to the Congress to survive the BJP's unceasing challenge in parliament. The polls in the northern state Uttar Pradesh will test that equation, analysts said. Seven of 10 Indian prime ministers have come from Uttar Pradesh, which according to the 1991 census had a population of 140 million people out of over 920 million in India. &quot;We are going to fight the elections to win an outright victory. It doesn't matter what effect it has on the central government,&quot; Congress President for Uttar Pradesh, Jitendra Prasada, said in a television interview. Prasada, a Rao loyalist in a fractious Congress, was hoping that a good showing in Uttar Pradesh would take the heat off his leader over a string of scandals that have brought calls for Rao's resignation as party president, Congress leaders said. Prasada's remarks signal Rao's worries about his own survival even if that means dumping Deve Gowda if it came in the way of its campaign in Uttar Pradesh, Congress leaders said. Uttar Pradesh was the main support base of the Congress until 1989 when its fortunes began to wane in successive local polls in Uttar Pradesh, variously against the BJP and the regional Samajwadi Party of socialist Defence Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav. The Samajawadi Party won 16 seats in parliament in the general polls, highest after the BJP's 52 from the state's 85 seats. Deve Gowda's Janata Dal party won two seats and the Congress five, a far cry from all the 85 seats it won in 1984. The BJP emerged as the single largest group in parliament in the April/May elections, with the largest share of its 160 deputies coming from Uttar Pradesh, where it is campaigning to build a Hindu temple at the site of a mosque razed by its supporters in December 1992. Most analysts say the BJP which won 34 percent votes in the state in this year's general elections looked likely to win a majority in the state assembly. The United Front on Monday moved to check bickerings among its varied groups to prevent that from happening, saying the alliance would contest the polls under one common poll symbol. &quot;We hope to sort it out within three or four days,&quot; Information Minister C.M Ibrahim, a key Deve Gowda aide, said. He has accompanied the prime minister on a string of recent visits to the state to canvass support for the alliance. The Congress which got eight percent votes in the general polls in Uttar Pradesh has struck an alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) of mostly low caste Hindus. The state was put under New Delhi's direct rule after the BSP ditched Yadav and formed its own government last year. But unable to prove a majority, the BSP governmnent resigned. Yadav's Samajawadi Party and the BSP had an equal share of 21 percent votes each. Deve Gowda's Janata Dal party with four percent votes won two seats in the state. A Janata Dal meeting over the weekend decided to accept Yadav's leadership in the state polls, a point stressed again by the prime minister on Monday when he dismissed reports of a rift within the United Front.
C17,C174,CCAT,E21,E212,ECAT	 Had Latin America's former dictators been communists, the region's creditworthiness, at least on paper, would have been stronger. Compared to Eastern Europe's recent converts to capitalism, Latin America's major economies look in a sorry state based on their grades from the major credit rating agencies. Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela, Latin America's Big Four, are rated well below Croatia, the Czech republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and the Slovak Republic -- all of which have attained the coveted investment grade. Indeed, investors scouring the globe will find Latin America's four largest economies near, or at the bottom of virtually all major emerging markets. Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's Investor Services both have South Africa, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand higher. And some analysts have begun to ask the obvious: Why? ING Barings last year introduced its own sovereign risk model to measure creditworthiness. &quot;It (the model) determines that Latin American sovereign issuers are apt to be rated one notch lower -- all other variables being equal -- than the rest of the sovereign issuer universe,&quot; ING said recently. Compared to other emerging markets, &quot;the Latins do seem relatively punished,&quot; said David Sckiguichi, an economist at J.P. Morgan in Venezuela. Others, such as Tulio Vera, sovereign analyst at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co in New York says &quot;major Latin American countries still face the challenge of liability management.&quot; INDEBTEDNESS CRUCIAL IN RATINGS Vera said a country's level of indebtedness is crucial in ratings, because the agencies judge a country's &quot;ability to pay.&quot; That means the low external debt levels of countries like Poland, Hungary and China allow them investment-grade status. Latin American leaders know all too well the cost of their relatively high external debt levels. It makes them dependent on fickle foreign investors and can increase the cost of their debt service payments at a stroke. The still low levels of exports relative to external debt in many countries is a key factor often cited by analysts as holding back the regions' creditworthiness. But the recent upgrades of Brazil and Argentina, in addition to statements by ratings officials and economists, has led to hopes that the region may be about to catch up with other emerging markets. In March, S&amp;P upgraded Brazil to BB-minus from B-plus, and Argentina to BB from BB-minus. John Lonski, senior economist at Moody's, showed his agency was also taking note. &quot;If Latin American nations continue to make economic and fiscal progress, countries like Argentina and Brazil -- both rated at B1 -- have a good shot at improving their creditworthiness,&quot; he said in December. S&amp;P also raised its outlook to &quot;positive&quot; from &quot;stable&quot; on Venezuela's B rating in January. The country is moving into its second year of economic reforms, armed with a war chest of petrodollars and hard-to-reverse policy moves like privatisation and fiscal restructuring. Analysts are optimistic an upgrade will come soon. INVESTMENT GRADE SOME WAY OFF Even so, the sought investment grade, which would open the doors to billions of dollars barred from investing in speculative-grade debt, is probably still a way off for most of the region. That is reflected by the &quot;stable&quot; outlooks on Mexico, Brazil and Argentina's ratings. Analysts say it may take at least four or five years before Brazil, Argentina, Mexico or Venezuela become investment-grade. Analysts point to weak banking sectors that revealed their vulnerability to external shocks during the Mexican Tequila crisis as one important point impeding upgrades. Other factors in part explain the gap, such as Asia's booming economies, and Latin America's low level of investment in social services like education and health. But most of all, differentiating Latin America from the Asian &quot;tigers&quot; which have long since become investment grade, are the low domestic savings rates which make the region so dependent on external capital. COMMITMENT TO REFORM SPREADING Despite all this, analysts say, it is clear that political commitment to the reform process in the region is spreading. &quot;The problems Latin America has are political and the source of the problems are the populists who have dominated politics for the whole century,&quot; said Mauro Schneider, an economist at ING Barings in Brazil. &quot;To some extent, this is a thing of the past.&quot; Perhaps Argentina exemplifies this better than most as across-the-board political support for its reform process is gaining ground. So much so, in fact, that recently Citicorp Chairman John Reed even predicted :&quot;Argentina will be investment grade this year.&quot; &quot;The achievement of price stability and financial predictability has created strong support for the convertibility plan (pegging the peso to the dollar) and would make it foolhardy for Argentine politicians to oppose it,&quot; said Lucy Gallagher, S&amp;P's director of sovereign ratings after the upgrade. And Chile's investment grade shows that status is perfectly possible in the region -- but it may take 15 years of reforms. Colombia's record of 40 years of uninterrupted growth and strong debt management which have made it the second investment grade country in the area is another example flying in the face of a &quot;bias.&quot; &quot;I'd expect to see more upgrades among the Latins, so long as the region's reforms continue,&quot; said Sckiguichi. Indeed, the upgrade of Uruguay by IBCA, the European credit rating agency and Duff &amp; Phelps in January, making it Latin America's third investment grade country, showed that.

C24,CCAT,GCAT,GVIO	 The Nigerian unit of Royal Dutch Shell Group said on Friday it was sending a team to assess six flow stations in its western division occupied for six days by Nigerian tribesmen in a political protest. The occupation of the stations near Warri in the midwest ended on Thursday when the protesters freed the last batch of 53 Shell oil workers they were holding hostage. &quot;The protesters left yesterday. We are sending out our people to assess the state of the facilities,&quot; said a Shell spokesman in Lagos. Shell says if there was not much damage done to the flow stations then oil production would resume soon. About 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil has been shut in there since last Saturday when Ijaw tribesmen seized the flow stations in protest at the relocation by the military authorities of their local government headquarters. Another 110,000 bpd of oil has also been shut in since last Saturday in Nembe creek in the southeast where villagers protesting against a merger of two communities into one local government area in the recently-created Bayelsa state ordered Shell to stop oil production. &quot;In Nembe the situation has not changed,&quot; said the Shell spokesman. He said the five flow stations involved in that sector had not been occupied by local communities but there was no oil production going there. &quot;What happened in Nembe is that the people gave us 12 hours to shut down and evacuate the flow stations. They agreed that we should keep a small police contigent to guard the place but there is no occupation of the stations by the communities.&quot; The communities are Ogbolomobiri and Bassambiri, which the government fused to produce one local government council chairman in municipal polls on March 15. The oil communities have long been restive over the lack of modern amenities in their areas despite being the place where Nigeria derives the money that sustains the country and they frequently vent their wrath on oil companies. --Lagos newsroom +234 1 2630317
C21,CCAT,E51,ECAT,M11,M12,MCAT	 Swiss fund managers, among the world's most important with an estimated $1.2 trillion Swiss francs ($898 billion) under management, are cutting U.S. exposure, carefully stock-picking in Europe and holding onto plenty of cash in 1997. Many are increasing cash holdings at the cost of bonds and equities and are particularly jittery over U.S. markets amid fears of an economic slowdown and higher interest rates. &quot;In 1997, we'll have to be very careful not to lose money. Most funds in Switzerland are taking a very defensive stance with a lot of cash and not much in equities or bonds,&quot; said Luca Dal Dosso, fund manager at Union Bank of Switzerland. Many Swiss fund managers are underweight in U.S. markets in favour of Europe, where they are chasing restructuring companies that have cheered shareholders with better earnings prospects. As for the emerging world, few among Switzerland's conservative money managers are prepared to go into these risky markets although bankers say they will be a magnet for cash flying out of low-yielding, stable developed markets. Marc Polydor, investment manager of Union Bancaire Privee, was bullish about European equities. &quot;There's so much good potential and visibility now in European corporate restructuring,&quot; he said. &quot;In Europe, earnings will rise, there'll be a lot of investment opportunities. It's just next door -- why should I go and buy something in Russia?&quot; But Serge Robin, a member of senior management and head of research at Lombard Odier &amp; Cie, saw flat returns in Europe and a slowdown in liquidity creation. &quot;We're quite prudent about markets in 1997. The second part of the year could turn nasty. The share of cash will increase in our asset allocations,&quot; he said. Data on the exact volume of riches under management are hard to come by in secretive Switzerland. &quot;That's a figure you won't get anywhere. Swiss banks are rather secretive,&quot; said Nick Fliess at Intrag, which manages mutual funds for Union Bank of Switzerland. A survey by Bank Julius Baer said Swiss institutional investors will have two trillion Swiss francs under management by 2000, more than double the current Swiss bourse capitalisation. The bank estimated total assets under management by Swiss government pension funds and accident insurance funds, pension funds, private insurers, banks, investment funds and societies and industrial concerns at 1.224 trillion francs at end-1995. Sizeable chunks of this cash are sitting in dollar portfolios of fund managers. Lombard Odier has more than tripled its cash holdings to 35 percent for 1997 from 10 percent this year. The ratio is 25 percent at Pictet &amp; Cie and Union Bancaire Privee. Robin said Swiss fund managers involved in the Far East might shift assets out of Hong Kong into South Korea. Elsewhere, Japanese equities were likely to attract more cash from Swiss funds in 1997, he added. Despite the cautious market outlook, assets under Swiss management are continuing to grow and mutual funds are emerging as one of the fastest growing areas, bankers said. BOPP ISB, a Swiss fund statistician, put assets invested in Swiss mutual funds at 226 billion Swiss francs in November, up from 184 billion at the end of 1995. More than half of buyers into these funds are non-Swiss. More banks are also offering special funds to fill in the gaps in their mutual fund families. Total assets under management in mutual funds at UBS, the second biggest with a third of the market share, grew 22 percent in 1996 to 65 billion Swiss francs. The increase in new cash flows accounted for nearly half of this growth.
M14,M142,MCAT	 Istanbul gold exchange volume jumped to 2,097 kg on Friday from Thursday's 802 amid arbitrage trading from banks and physical demand from the free market, dealers said. They said volume was weak in the futures market launched today but interest was encouraging. &quot;Traders and investors in general preferred to wait and see because it was the first day. But there was strong interest and the spreads fell to around 20 cents, which was positive. Most of the contracts were made by banks taking up positions,&quot; said one banker. Spot gold closed easier at $325.00 an ounce and 1,717,500 lira per gram, versus $327.50 and 1,721,000 lira at Thursday's close. The drop in the lira price was cushioned by the currency's weakness against the dollar. The lira eased to 163,850 against the dollar from Thursday's 163,250-300 close in line with the firmer dollar/mark parity. The bulk of spot trade was conducted in lira terms -- 1,422 kg -- and 1,618 kg of the total was n the first session. In futures trade, a total of 43 contracts traded in September, October and December. Closing prices were $325.90 for September, $327.00 for October and $327.2 for December. No lira term contracts were made in futures, which had a total daily turnover of $1.35 million. -- Istanbul newsroom +90-212-2750875
E12,ECAT	 The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said on Thursday it supported the government's structural reform drive and urged it to go further down the same road. &quot;The current poor economic performance can be attributed mainly to underlying structural weakness in the economy rather than to cyclical factors,&quot; the OECD said in its annual special survey of Germany. &quot;It is important to implement the package of labour market and other structural reforms in full,&quot; it added. It was referring to an austerity package that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government is implementing, designed to cut spending sharply next year and reduce firms' costs through deregulation and greater flexibility in the economy. &quot;A resumption of growth should not be allowed to weaken a determined effort to correct the structural problems which the downturn has once more made apparent and which have been exacerbated by the burden of unification,&quot; the OECD said. It rejected the opposition and trade union view that Kohl's reforms represented a dismantling of the welfare state. &quot;What is at stake is not a wholesale dismantling of the welfare state but rather reforms to place it on a sustainable basis by improving economic performance through better incentives,&quot; it said. The OECD applauded the government's emphasis on structural changes to tackle the country's record post-war unemployment, saying it was in line with the OECD's own Jobs Study. &quot;This may prove difficult to achieve but fundamental reform is in any case needed,&quot; the report said, forecasting that unemployment would remain around 10.4 percent in 1997 despite a cyclical economic recovery. It said further reforms were needed because unemployment benefits remained over-generous and the system contained little incentive for the unemployed to find work. Recipients only had to report to benefit offices every three months and criteria for refusing job offers were also generous. &quot;The steps taken by the government to limit the duration of unemployment assistance and to reduce reference wages are modest moves in the right direction. But even after these reforms, the system will remain very generous,&quot; it said. Further reforms to the state pension system was also needed to put it on a sound long-term footing against a background of an increasingly ageing population, it said. It supported the government's attempts to reduce sick-pay and workers' protection from firing, saying that these currently contained disincentives for employees to work and for employers to create jobs. Of &quot;critical importance&quot; was reform and simplification of the country's income tax system and an overhaul of company and wealth tax systems, something Bonn was already looking at, it added. -- Ashley Seager, Bonn newsroom, 49-228-2609750
GCAT,GPOL,GVOTE	 New York City's Mayor Rudolph Giuliani ended a year of speculation and gave Bob Dole the nod Saturday, saying he endorsed the Republican presidential candidate and would vote for him next month. Giuliani, a Republican in a heavily Democratic city, made his choice known with Jack Kemp, Dole's running mate, at his side. The two men, longtime friends, met privately at LaGuardia Airport shortly after 6:30 p.m. EDT (2230 GMT). After the announcement they went directly to Yankee Stadium with their families for the sixth game of the World Series, which the Yankees lead three games to two. &quot;I'm voting for Senator Dole and Jack Kemp. I support them, and I'm going to urge other people to do that. I endorse them,&quot; Giuliani said. Kemp thanked the mayor on behalf of the Dole-Kemp team and called the endorsement &quot;an act of statesmanship.&quot; &quot;This is a very strong signal from the mayor of the most important financial centre in this whole global economy. This sends a signal to governors and to mayors all over the country that Bob Dole and Jack Kemp are serious about our cities,&quot; Kemp said. It was no coincidence that the two Republican politicians made the announcement before a bust of Fiorello LaGuardia, a popular Republican mayor of New York from 1934 to 1945 and the man for whom the airport is named. Giuliani said that like many voters, he was making up his mind about whom to vote for in the last 10 days of the campaign. &quot;My endorsement is a very positive one ... I believe Senator Dole is the right person to be president,&quot; he said. Giuliani's eleventh-hour decision may lose a lot of its punch by coming before a critical World Series game. Political columnists said the mayor scheduled his announcement to make sure it did not get wide play in the news media. In 1994 Giuliani, who is considered a renegade by local Republican leaders, angered many in his party by crossing over and endorsing Democrat Mario Cuomo for governor. Republican George Pataki won a surprise victory in that race and Giuliani has paid a political price for his disloyalty. The mayor has also rejected the Republican Party's support for stricter controls on immigration, casting himself as the mayor of a city of immigrants. In recent days some top local Republicans have distanced themselves from Dole, who is expected to lose New York state. During his first political debate with President Clinton, Dole made a point of mentioning Giuliani's name twice in referring to his lowering of the crime rate in New York.
C11,C24,CCAT	 Thailand's Poonpipat Finance and Securities Plc has suspended operations at three provincial offices due to the current economic downturn in the country, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. The firm will temporarily shut its offices in northeastern Roi-et, Pathum Thani near Bangkok, and Ratchaburi south of the capital on July 31, the firm said. The securities trading operations at the closed branches has failed to meet expectations due to current poor economic conditions, it said. Poonpipat's remaining provincial office in the southern city of Songkla remains open.
C31,C311,CCAT	 Automakers have steered most of their investments in former communist Europe into major economies like Poland and Russia, but the region's most developed car market is tiny Slovenia, according to a new study. &quot;Slovenia is the most economically advanced country in central and eastern Europe,&quot; said Elaine Hardy, director of the study for British auto consultancy Harbour Wade Brown. &quot;All of our statistics indicate that Slovenia is in many ways like a west European country,&quot; Hardy added. The country's attraction is easy to miss, she said, because its population is barely two million people and its new vehicle sales totalled only 66,360 units in 1996. But that translates into sales of 3,318 units per 100,000 people -- the region's highest ratio and almost as high as the west European average of 3,390, according to the study. Slovenia's closest rival on this measure is the Czech Republic, where the ratio was only half as high at 1,711 units per 100,000 people, Hardy said. Overall, new vehicle sales in central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union totalled 1.83 million units or 446 units per 100,000 people. &quot;The gap that still separates these two parts of Europe becomes clear when you realize that it would take central and eastern Euorpe 22 years to replenish its vehicle population, while it would take western Europe only 13 years,&quot; Hardy said. Slovenia also outperforms larger countries in market size. In February 1997, new vehicle sales totalled 6,351 units in Slovenia and 5,479 units in Hungary, which has five times the population, according to a Reuters survey. &quot;One of the reasons that Slovenia has such a strong market is its dealer network, which is quite similar in development to western Europe,&quot; Hardy said. &quot;Slovenia has historically close relations with Austria and Italy, and it shows.&quot; Slovenia, part of the former Yugoslavia until 1991, has 27 dealers per 100,000 people, only one less than western Europe, the study said. By contrast, dealers per 100,000 people totalled 17 in Greece and 16 in Portugal. But Slovenia has other strengths, such as its relatively high living standard, leading to costs that have hurt its ability to attract foreign investment. Monthly wages average $995, and per-capita gross domestic product is around $11,500, Hardy said. &quot;I'm not surprised that no one wants to build cars in Slovenia... It's like the Switzerland of central and eastern Europe,&quot; she said. In fact, Renault SA of France is the only automaker with a major investment in Slovenia, where it has built cars since 1972. Renault's unique position in Slovenia has enabled it to maintain a market share of around 25 percent while other automakers producing elsewhere in the region have seen their market share tumble. Italian conglomerate Fiat SPA, the architect of Poland's auto industry, has watched the market share for its Fiat brand in Poland erode to 39 percent in 1996 from 49 percent in 1993. -- Budapest newsroom (36 1) 327 4040
C31,CCAT,GCAT,GENT	 Emerging markets in Latin America and Asia are fueling growth in the $40 billion global music business, according to a trade group report released Wednesday. Developing markets accounted for 70 percent of growth in 1996, against only 20 percent in 1993, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) said in its study. Latin America and Asia are the most important developing markets, although the two regions still contributed only 6 percent each of total world sales in 1996. Unit sales rose 20 percent in Latin America last year, the fastest growth rate anywhere in the world. Annual global sales growth has averaged 5 percent over the past five years. But real growth in value, excluding the effects of inflation, fell to just 2 percent in 1996 from a peak of 11 percent in 1994. The global music industry is dominated by five major international players -- PolyGram NV, EMI Group Plc, Sony Corp., Bertelsmann AG and Time Warner Inc. unit Warner Bros. The slowdown in growth has prompted a painful round of restructuring, with the majors shedding jobs and cutting costs as they attempt to adapt to life after the gold rush. Unit sales in the U.S. market shrank by 7 percent last year, the report said. But the United States still heads the global charts, annual sales topping $12 billion in 1996, almost double those of Japan, the world's second largest market, followed by Germany, Britain, France and Brazil. The compact disc has continued its unstoppable rise, with sales more than doubling over the five-year period to 2.1 billion units in 1996. The demise of vinyl appears to be almost complete, with sales of old-format LPs dwindling to just 21 million last year. Britons emerge as the world's biggest music fans, buying an average of four albums each per year. At the other end of the scale, Africa is identified as a massively underdeveloped market. The continent had sales last year of $250 million -- roughly the equivalent of those of a small European country such as Norway.

GCAT,GSPO	 Former Borussia Moenchengladbach coach Bernd Krauss will take over at Real Sociedad of Spain next season on a two-year contract, German sports news agency SID reported on Thursday. Moenchengaldbach sacked Krauss in December last year after a poor first half of the season left them in relegation danger. But the coach was regarded as a success during most of his four years at the club, leading them to the German Cup in 1995. Krauss will replace Javier Irureta, whose contract with the former Spanish champions will not be renewed. &quot;This is a great chance for a young coach,&quot; the 39-year-old former Austrian international said. SID said Krauss had signed his contract with Real on Wednesday and watched the team, currently eighth in the Spanish league, in action last weekend. &quot;The team may be mid-table but it has great prospects,&quot; Krauss said. &quot;It's better to go to a club like that than to take over a Bundesliga side fighting against relegation.&quot;
M11,MCAT	 Wall Street stocks were mixed Wednesday after a sell-off triggered by unfounded rumours that Russian President Boris Yeltsin's health was failing. At 1 p.m. EDT, the Dow was down 30.56 points at 5,936.21, after rebounding from a fall of nearly 50 points. In the broader market, declining issues led advances 13-8 on volume of 241 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The Nasdaq Composite index rose was up 0.97 of a point at 1,241.12 following Tuesday's strong September book-to-bill report, a measure of the semiconductor industry's activity. The American Stock Exchange index lost 2.00 to 580.01. Stocks rebounded from their lows in late morning after Russian officials denied the rumour, asserting that Yeltsin was fine and working at a sanatorium outside Moscow. Analysts said, however, that the ease with which the speculation took prices lower was a symptom of a nervous market. &quot;There's no question that during volatile markets, rumours and political news have more impact,&quot; said Peggy Farley, chief executive at Amas Securities. &quot;With the market a little nervous, which it is right now, it's more vulnerable.&quot; Stocks won over yet another convert, with Morgan Stanley's Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Byron Wien changing his model U.S. equity portfolio, increasing the money allocated to stocks and decreasing cash, each by 5 percent. Morgan Stanley said the move, which puts the portfolio at 85 percent stocks and 15 percent cash reflected a change in Wien's near-term view. Wien had been forecasting a 1,000-point fall in the Dow. &quot;Now he thinks (interest) rates are more likely to go lower because of some signs of temporary weakness in the economy,&quot; said Morgan Stanley strategist Leah Modigliani. &quot;Therefore, he thinks there may be a 10 percent upside to the market in the next six months,&quot; she said. Unlike the Dow index, which has encountered sustained profit-taking since it twice this week rallied briefly above 6,000 points, Nasdaq stocks were higher, with technology shares leading the way. The book-to-bill report, which showed surprising improvement in the computer chip market, boosted Intel Corp. by 5/8 to 102-5/16. Other strong chip and chip-related stocks included, Atmel Corp., up 1-3/8 to 33-7/8; Applied Materials Inc., up 1-3/8 to 29-3/8; and Lattice Semiconductor Corp., up 1-1/8 to 31-3/8. Among individual issues, Tellabs Inc. jumped 6-3/8 to 79-3/8 after reporting strong third-quarter earnings. Marvel Entertainment Group Inc. slid 2-1/8 to 5-7/8 on the company's warning that it would report a loss in the third quarter.
E12,ECAT	 Ecuador's Finance Minister Pablo Concha said Thursday he will announce the government's economic plan in two months but said that in the next few days he will come up with some individual measures. &quot;The plan will be ready in a couple of months,&quot; Concha told reporters. &quot;But we will announce individual measures such as the scrapping of a subsidy on domestic gas in a few more days.&quot; New populist President Abdala Bucaram announced weeks ago he would eliminate a subsidy on domestic gas which amounts to some $200 million per year and redirect the cash towards social funds. But Central Bank manager Augusto de la Torre had said earlier the funds would be used to reduce the country's fiscal gap, which according to the bank amounts to one percent of GDP. Concha said he was studying a mechanism to compensate lower income sectors from the likely increase in gas, but denied he was planning to raise wages. &quot;No subsidy will be made up by salary increments,&quot; Concha said. He also said the government would maintain the subsidy on diesel oil for electrical companies discarding any price readjustment in that sector. And he admitted that it would not be possible to implement one of Bucaram's electoral promises of scrapping a decree that allows for monthly hikes in the price of oil. &quot;Our fiscal reality is so dramatic that eliminating that mechanism is not a possibility,&quot; he said. Former conservative President Sixto Duran Ballen implemented the system by which oil is subject to monthly price readjustments. -- Maria Veronica Barreiros, Quito Newsroom + 5932 258433

GCAT,GSPO	 The Washington Bullets, losers of nine of their last 12 games, fired head coach Jim Lynam on Wednesday and named assistant Bob Staak interim head coach. &quot;I felt that it was necessary at this time to make a change in the head coaching position,&quot; said Bullets executive vice president and general manager Wes Unseld in a statement. &quot;We have committed a tremendous amount of resources to this team, but it just was not working.&quot; The Bullets spent more than $100 million to retain Juwan Howard to a multi-year contract and added point guard Rod Strickland in the off-season. Despite a nucleus of forward Chris Webber, Howard and Strickland, the Bullets are in fourth-place in the Atlantic Division with a 22-24 record.
M11,MCAT	 The Nairobi Stock Exchange 20-share index lost 59.10 points to stand at 3,477.07 on Monday under the weight of declining prices in the industrial sector. Turnover was posted at 23.308 million shillings on 385,538 shares from 52.796 million shillings on 1,213,320 shares. British American Tobacco Kenya lost 14.50 to 60 while Kenya Power &amp; Lighting eased to 120 from 122 as investors offloaded their shares into the market. On average, prices across the board eased marginally as investors traded hesitantly with a wait-and-see attitude. Foreign investors who have been responsible for the Nairobi bourse's upward movement in the last two weeks kept a low profile and traded moderately. They bought Kakuzi at a reserve price of 100 from 101 and East African Portland Cement at between 27.50 to 27.75 from 27.75. &quot;Today's trading gave the week a slow start, maybe because everyone is expecting year-end announcements from the big three banks any time this week,&quot; a senior broker said. He was referring to Barclays Bank, Standard Chartered Bank and Kenya Commercial Bank. The race (for profits) this year will be an interesting one to watch, said brokers, who added that although Barclays was the traditional market leader, Kenya Commercial Bank could surprise everyone -- especially since it had received a positive image boost after its public share offer in October 1996. Barclays Bank closed at 119 from 118 while National Bank of Kenya eased to 15.50 from 16. Standard Chartered Bank rose 1.0 to 57 while Kenya Commercial Bank closed at 96 from 95.50 boosted by foreign demand. The East African Development Bank corporate bond traded five million at 100.30 percent compared to 11 million at 99.99 percent on February 12. --Wambui Chege, Nairobi Newsroom ++254-2 330-261.
C15,C151,CCAT	 Citicorp, the second-largest U.S. bank holding company, said Tuesday its net income rose nine percent to $995 million in the first quarter despite continued weakness in U.S. consumer credit. The loss ratio in its U.S. credit card business rose to 5.91 percent in the quarter from 5.45 percent in the 1996 fourth quarter and 4.38 percent in the 1996 first quarter, Citicorp said. The increase in net income and the rise in the U.S. credit card loss ratio were close to Wall Street expectations.   Citicorp said consumer credit costs of $894 million were $50 million higher than the 1996 fourth quarter and $188 million higher than the 1996 first quarter. In the consumer business overall, the ratio of net credit losses to average managed loans was 2.69 percent in the 1997 first quarter, compared with 2.51 percent in the preceding quarter and 2.19 percent a year ago. Citicorp said its consumer businesses continued building the allowance for credit losses, adding $25 million to reserves above the net credit losses in cards.   Net income from emerging markets was $450 million or 69 percent of total corporate banking earnings. Net interest revenue in the quarter rose to $2.80 billion from $2.69 billion a year ago. The net interest revenue after the $423 million provision for credit losses was $2.38 billion versus $2.19 billion. Operating expenses rose 11 percent to $3.17 billion from $2.86 billion a year ago. Citicorp recorded a previously-announced $60 million pretax charge for the issuance of performance-based options.   Fee and commission revenue rose to $1.35 billion from $1.31 billion a year ago, an increase of three percent. Citicorp said it repurchased 6.1 million shares in the first quarter at a cost of $704 million. Average oustanding shares in the quarter, fully diluted, were 476.0 million versus 480.9 million in the fourth quarter of 1996 and 500.8 million in the first quarter of 1996. Trading related revenue rose to $589 million in the first quarter from $392 million a year ago, a gain of 50 percent.

GCAT,GPOL,GVIO,GVOTE	 China on Thursday expressed strong indignation over an election platform announced by Japan's biggest political party that reiterates Tokyo's claim to a disputed group of islands in the East China Sea. The platform announced by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) this week also included an endorsement of visits by cabinet ministers to a controversial Tokyo shrine to Japan's war dead. Tokyo is locked in a bitter dispute with Beijing over the ownership of the uninhabited islands it calls the Senkakus and Beijing calls the Diaoyus. The row has raised Chinese fears of a possible revival of Japanese militarism. &quot;We are very indignant about the wrong decision made by the LDP,&quot; the official Xinhua news agency quoted Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang as saying when asked about the Japanese party's election platform. Shen said Asian victims of past Japanese aggression always opposed visits to Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine, where 2.6 million Japanese who died in wars since last century are honoured and where war criminals executed after World War Two are enshrined. Japanese prime minister and LDP leader Ryutaro Hashimoto in July broke a decade-long taboo on prime ministerial visits to Yasukuni, saying it was time for Japan to stop apologising for honouring its fallen soldiers. Since the beginning of this year &quot;wrong actions&quot; by the Japanese side had seriously hurt Chinese feelings, said Shen. &quot;Everyone knows that the Yasukuni Shrine is for the souls of militarists,&quot; Xinhua quoted him as saying. On the potentially resource-rich Diaoyus, China's position was clear and Japan could not shake Beijing's determination, he said. Japan has claimed the islands since victory in a war against imperial China in 1895. Beijing says its claim, shared by political rival Taipei, dates back centuries. A long-dormant dispute over the islands erupted in July after a Japanese right-wing group erected a makeshift lighthouse on one of the islands. The row flared anew last week when a Hong Kong activist drowned after diving into stormy seas near the islands as part of a protest against Tokyo's sovereignty claim. Diplomats say China is eager to avoid any escalation of a dispute that threatens its ties with a vital economic partner. Analysts said this week the LDP, desperate to garner as many votes as possible in Japan's October 20 general election, had bowed to pressure from nationalists over its election platform.

C11,CCAT	 The Gulf Arab emirate of Abu Dhabi is setting up a leasing company that has already secured deals worth $300 million, officials said on Sunday. Officials close to the company said it would offer a variety of leasing contracts ranging from commercial aircraft to power plants, but would not elaborate on what deals have been secured. The founders, led by the state's Abu Dhabi Investment Company (ADIC) and the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), plan to make an initial public offering for the company later this year and form several subsidiaries to manage each leasing contract, they said. The public offering would initially be open to UAE nationals but the founders are also considering allowing investors from fellow Gulf Arab states -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain -- to take part. Officials said Abu Dhabi was expected to announce the deals secured so far as well as future plans after choosing one of two global leasing firms on a shortlist of companies seeking to participate in a joint venture with the new company. &quot;We have a shortlist and are about to decide,&quot; a UOG official told Reuters. The UOG expects the leasing concept to appeal to Gulf states which are trying to cut public spending as they recover from low oil prices and large costs of the 1991 Gulf War.

M13,M132,MCAT	 The dollar ended more than a pfennig lower here compared with Thursday's close, caught in the crossfire of the sharp losses in both U.S. stocks and bonds. Asset markets were roiled by comments late Thursday from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, who spoke of how central banks could manage to successfully puncture asset market bubbles. This raised concerns about an imminent U.S. interest rate rise and sent the bond martket into a tailspin. News today, however, of a lower-than-expected rise 118,000 rise in U.S November non-farm payrolls calmed asset markets and allowed the dollar to recover half of its overnight losses.   &quot;The general backdrop of asset market uncertainty at this time of year is not good news for the dollar because it encourages a paring of extreme positioning in all markets at a time when funds are still net long of dollars,&quot; said Klaus Baader, currency strategist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. There also tends to be preference for low-inflation &quot;safe haven&quot; cash, traditionally marks and Swiss francs, during such market upheavals, as well as a drift away from the markets of large net debtor countries such as the U.S., Baader said. At 1630 GMT, the dollar was trading 1.5450/55 marks compared with 1.5515/22 marks on Thursday and an intraday low at 1.5485.   Some economists said the softer-than-expected headline rise in U.S. payrolls was not as benign as the rest of the employment report suggested. Upward revisions to October and September payrolls and a rise in average hourly earnings helped offset any headline softness. This leaves the background risk of a rise in U.S. rates in the coming months very much alive. Yet, while sharp losses in stocks and bonds would tend to undermine the currency in the short-term, expectations of a higher interest rates and a higher relative return on U.S. assets should also support it. Others say the U.S. will not be the currency market focus next week anyway.   To some extent, the dollar/mark moves over the past 24 hours are more indicative of repositioning on European currencies than the U.S. unit itself. The relative stability of dollar/yen today, for example, is a case in point. Moreover, Bundesbank council member Reimut Jochimsen said today that the recent dollar/mark gains were not to do with some renewed strength in the U.S. unit but rather a bout of weakness in the European currency bloc. Bundesbank concern about any fresh mark appreciation was illustrated by reports of Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer's description of the dollar's retreat today as &quot;exaggerated.&quot;   &quot;I think the story will return quickly to Europe ahead of the Dublin EU summit next weekend,&quot; said Julian Jessop, economist at Nikko Europe. &quot;Hopes of a budget stability pact at the meeting will increase EMU optimism again and weigh on the mark ultimately.&quot; &quot;One thing that's for sure is that all ministers going to the summit will want to see the dollar higher and the mark weaker and any comments around the meeting will be spun that way,&quot; said Jessop, who said dollar/mark could well bounce back above 1.55 early next week. --Mike Dolan, London newsroom +44 171 542 6762

C11,C24,CCAT	 State metals firm Empresa Nacional de Mineria SA (Enami) plans a &quot;strategic alliance&quot; with private mining companies at its Paipote smelter but will keep the plant's ownership entirely in state hands, Mining Minister Benjamin Teplizky said. Teplizky said Enami is considering some kind of association with Paipote's clients, mainly small and medium sized Chilean copper mines, to bring capital to Paipote and give them a stake in the business. But the deal would not involve any transfer or loosening Paipote's state ownership, he told reporters for foreign media. &quot;What we're trying to do with Enami is form associations with producers, setting aside the issue of property...but making the association as mixed as possible,&quot; he said. &quot;It's all still under study...but what we want to do is a kind of strategic alliance between Enami, the workers, and the medium-sized mining sector, which is Paipote's main client,&quot; he said. As potential partners, he mentioned copper mining company Punta del Cobre and a private trade group, the National Mining Society. &quot;So we're inviting the producers who are clients of Enami to participate in the smelting business. What's in it for them is that they get into the business,&quot; he said. An association could eventually lead to an expansion at Paipote to include copper refining, so that it would make high-grade cathodes rather than just blister at present. The expansion would cost in the neighborhood of $150 million but there is no timetable yet, he said. The plant outside the northern city of Copiapo has been the subject of much speculation about whether Enami might sell all or part of it. Local reports have said Punta del Cobre or U.S. firm Phelps Dodge Corp, which owns the nearby Candelaria plant, are interested in buying into it. Teplizky said political pressures ran strongly against privatization of any of Enami, which buys concentrates from small and medium-sized producers who might otherwise have nowhere to sell. &quot;The whole problem of Enami requires a solution that does not involve its property. It's a conflict-ridden issue, one in which not all Chileans are going to agree,&quot; he said, adding that he saw no chance of a partial privatization at Paipote. Enami's smelted copper output was about 190,000 tonnes last year and is due to rise to about 204,000 by the year 2000. The company's other major plant, the smelter and refinery at Ventanas near Vina del Mar, could also have an alliance but with state copper company Codelco, rather than with private producers, said Teplizky.

C34,CCAT	 Competition and rationalisation made little progress in 1996 in the New Zealand electricity industry, according to a report prepared by Ernst&amp; Young. &quot;Rationalisation within the New Zealand electricity continues at a slow pace... Competition within the retail electricity sector has also made only slow progress,&quot; author Joanna Sofield said. The report said the industry overall was not achieving commercially appropriate returns.   &quot;Profits overall in the industry are inadequate and poor financial results from some power companies are a concern,&quot; Sofield said. She said a small improvement in industry returns in 1996 appeared to have come from efficiency gains rather than increased prices. Average line charges per unit distributed fell in 1996 by three percent.   However, while efficiency gains caused direct and indirect cost measures to fall by 11 percent and 18 percent respectively, the report says the opportunity existed for dramatic cost savings in a large number of Electric Power Companies (EPCs). She said power companies could achieve significant economies of scale if their relatively fixed operating costs were spread over a larger customer base. &quot;Given these economies of scale, which are reflected in the size of power companies in other countries, New Zealand still has too many EPCs,&quot; Sofield said.   At the end of March 1996 there were 40 EPCs against 43 a year earlier and 47 in 1993. Sofield said that in theory customers had been able to purchase electricity from the retailer of their choice. But while 26 power companies distributed electricity sold by competing electricity retailers, the volume represented only seven percent of total retail electricity distributed. Ernst &amp; Young expects changes in metering technology combined with innovative marketing strategies to lead to increased competition across the total customer base in the near future.   Ernst &amp; Young has compiled an index to assess overall performance of power companies' line businesses ranking a range of areas including profitability and pricing. Scores ranged from 87 to 27 with the the top three being Electricity Invercargill, Dunedin Electricity and Alpine Energy. Most of the top line businesses are urban based. The report said rural power companies would only be able to match their urban counterparts by forming larger, more efficient companies covering areas with greater customer density. -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746
C13,CCAT,E21,E212,ECAT	 Howard Gary &amp; Co was removed from a Dade County seaport bond issue because of allegations involving company president Howard Gary, county Finance Director Ed Marquez said Wednesday. The firm was to act as senior manager for the $30 million Port of Miami revenue bond issue, which is expected to be priced at the end of the month.   Last week, The Miami Herald reported that Gary had secretly recorded a conversation in which he offered Dade County Commissioner James Burke $100,000 to win a spot for Gary's firm on a Dade County revenue bond refunding for a recyling plant. The newspaper said Gary acted in cooperation with federal prosecutors. Federal prosecutors have declined to comment on the allegations and neither Gary nor Burke has been charged with any wrongdoing. Burke has resigned as chairman of the county commission's finance committee but remains a commissioner.   Marquez said Gary's firm would be removed from the seaport deal at recommendation of the county manager's finance committee. &quot;We are taking him off the transaction, the primary reason of it being the allegations in the press,&quot; Marquez said. &quot;We fully realize it's just allegations. There may be disclosure concerns on the issue.&quot; He said Howard Gary &amp; Co would remain in the county's bond underwriting pool. &quot;Whatever clouds there are, hopefully the allegations will be alleviated,&quot; Marquez said. An official at Howard Gary &amp; Co, citing company policy, declined to comment. Marquez said the committee had recommended another firm to act as senior manager for the deal but that the firm owuld not be identified until conty officials contacted them. The county will use proceeds from the seaport bond issue to buy a cruise ship terminal built at the Port of Miami by Carnival Corp. --Jane Sutton, 305-374-5013
M11,MCAT	 Madrid stocks continued their record run on Wednesday, ending at fresh closing highs which dealers said was more a reflection of the fact that there were few sellers rather than any new incentives to buy. The general index rose 9.78 points, 1.61 percent, to 618.36 and the Ibex added 125.03 points, 1.79 percent, to 7,094.94. Gains were concentrated in Repsol, Telefonica, pushing up after a period of underperformance in heavy trade. Telefonica broke key resistance at 4,415 pesetas to end up 125 pesetas to 4,440. Participants said a correction was due, with the Ibex now more expensive than some core markets. However they could not see when this might emerge, with investment fund flows into the market continuing to push up prices beyond fair values. &quot;This is madness. There haven't been any sellers all day so prices have had to rocket. It's going to take a shock news item to bring the market down, and when it does it'll come down hard,&quot; said a dealer at a foreign brokerage in Madrid. Some talked of a possible new rate cut at Thursday's Bank of Spain repo auction. But most dismissed the idea. All ten analysts polled by Reuters today agreed the central bank will hold its key money rate at 5.25 percent on Thursday.
C13,C31,C312,CCAT,G15,G153,GCAT,M14,M141,MCAT	 Further frenetic bidding is expected on December 19 at the European Union's last grain export tender in 1996 as traders scramble for licences to cover an upsurge in demand, European Commission officials said. They confirmed there would be a two-week gap during the end of year holidays with the first 1997 tender to be held on January 9. &quot;Everybody thought business was over for the year. Now people are nervous. They can't risk missing out at next week's tender,&quot; said a Commission official. India's unexpected purchase of one million tonnes of Australian wheat, Iraq's return to the market and disruption of the Argentine harvest due to rain have put European traders on their toes. India said on Thursday it will import a total of two million tonnes of wheat in fiscal 1996/97 (April/March) to increase domestic supplies and check rising prices. In Paris, grain traders said talks have started on an Iraqi tender to buy 100,000 tonnes of French wheat with oil export revenue after the United Nations eased sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Trade reports that Uzbekistan had bought EU wheat could not immediately be confirmed in Brussels. European Commission grain officials denied they were restricting grain exports due to budget pressure. The Commission's farm budget director, Michel Jacquot, had warned on Monday that the EU would have difficulty subsidising the export of a much larger crop this year, expecially after one billion Ecus was taken from farm funds to fight mad cow disease. Although wheat export refunds were currently more than triple the level envisaged in the budget, barley refunds were much lower, an official noted. &quot;On balance there is no reason to ring alarm bells,&quot; the official said. Rejecting trade complaints that the EU was restricting wheat exports, officials noted that licences for just over one million tonnes, including 550,000 tonnes for Africa under a special refund scheme, were awarded at Thursday's tender. The rest consisted of 477,000 tonnes of open-market wheat and followed around 430,000 tonnes granted the previous week. Excited traders had bid on Thursday for refunds to export 1.3 million tonnes of wheat. --Peter Blackburn Brussels Bureau +322 287 6830
E21,E211,ECAT	 Bulgaria's central government budget deficit rose by 2.7 billion levs in the second half of August to 72.4 billion levs or 89.7 percent of the revised 1996 deficit target, finance ministry figures show. Expenditure rose by 12.7 billion levs to 235.3 billion levs between August 17-30, which is 53.6 (corrects from 76.3) percent of that planned for the whole year in the revised budget. Revenue grew by 10 billion levs to 162.9 billion levs or 45.5 (corrects from 65.1) percent of the target. Bulgaria's parliament revised on July 30 the country's 1996 budget in a move to meet higher foreign and domestic debt payments and to keep the structural reform on track. Revenue was set at 358.2 billion levs and spending at 438.9 billion levs. The deficit was assumed at 4.9 percent of gross domestic product or 80.7 billion levs, up from the original 58.3 billion levs. Under the revised 1996 budget Bulgaria will allocate  52.6 percent or 321 billion levs of expenditure planned for the year to cover interest payments on foreign and domestic debt. -- Sofia Newsroom, (++359-2) 84561

M13,M132,MCAT	 The dollar will move modestly higher against other currencies in the short term but over the medium to long term it will move lower, economist C. Fred Bergsten said on Thursday. &quot;The U.S. is the only major industrial country which is growing strongly,&quot; Bergsten told reporters. &quot;My short term expectation would be for some further modest increase in the value of the dollar, simply because the U.S. economy is stronger our interest rates are likely to go up modestly...,&quot; Bergsten said.   However, he said that over the medium-term the prospects were different. He expected President Bill Clinton to win this November's U.S. elections and that there would be an agreement early next year between Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress to balance the budget over the next four or five years. &quot;I think that's very easy to do now and I think it will happen. That in turn will bring the yield on the (30-year) long bond down very substantially and it'll lead to a substantial decline in the dollar,&quot; Bergsten said. He said that the creation of the Euro in January, 1999 would also lead to some portfolio diversification into that currency from the dollar. He added the dollar could well fall some 10 to 15 percent over the next three years. Bergsten, Director of the Institute for International Economics, was in Singapore to give a lecture at the National University of Singapore. -- Singapore newsroom (65) 870-3080
M14,M142,MCAT	 Indian 24 carat gold on Thursday ended 35 rupees lower at 4,400 rupees per 10 grammes but up 10 rupees from the opening level of 4,390 rupees on the back of a world market recovery, dealers said. Gold was down by 45 rupees per 10 grammes on Wednesday. Physical demand remained low but speculative interest and lower inflows dragged prices upward later in the day. Prices of a gold biscuit (116.50 grammes) closed 400 rupees lower at 51,500 rupees against the previous close of 51,900 rupees but was up 100 rupees against the opening level of 51,400 rupees.

GCAT,GCRIM,GVIO	 An Algerian court on Monday sentenced six Moslem militants to death in absentia for involvement in guerrilla activities, the official Algerian news agency APS said. The criminal court of Medea, 70 km (45 miles) south of Algiers, convicted the six men of belonging to an armed &quot;terrorist&quot; group, voluntary manslaughter, ambush attacks, arson and destruction of property, APS said. Medea is a Moslem guerrilla stronghold of Algeria's ruthless Armed Islamic Group (GIA) guerrilla movement. More than 1,200 Moslem fundamentalists have been condemned to death, mostly in absentia, since 1993 when Algerian courts started trials of Moslem activists. About 60,000 people have been killed in Algeria's civil strife pitting Moslem guerrillas against government forces since early 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which Islamists had taken a commanding first round lead.

C24,CCAT	 Garnet Resources Corp said Thursday production tests on its Toroyaco-4 development well produced 29 degree gravity oil at rates of 1,125 barrels per day from the Villeta U sand and 1,135 barrels per day from Villeta T sand. A commingled production test of both zones has been initiated, the company said, adding it also plans to perform a hydraulic fracture stimulation procedure on both zones, which is expected to increase the rates obtained on test. Garnet has a 55 percent interest in the venture which drilled the Toroyaco well with the remaining 45 percent held by Aviva Petroleum Inc. Interests held by the Colombian government reduce Garnet's revenue interest to about 15 percent, vice president W. Kirk Bosche said. The Toroyaco-4 is the first of up to four development locations identified by a 3-D seismic survey conducted over the Toroyaco and Linda fields last year, the company noted. Following the completion of the Toroyaco-4 well, the drilling rig was moved to the Linda-4 development location, where drilling was recently started, it said. -- New York Newsdesk 212-859-1610

C18,C183,CCAT	 Lithuania's European Affairs Minister Laima Andrikiene said on Friday that bids to draw up a privatisation plan for stevedoring companies KLASCO and Smelte would be announced in April. &quot;In April, we will anounce bids to draw up privatisation programmes for...KLASCO and Smelte,&quot; Andrikiene told a news conference. Both companies have been included on a list of 14 key state enterprises in the transport, communications and energy sectors that have been slated for privatisation. Klaipeda-based KLASCO is the country's largest stevedoring firm. It handled 7.6 million tonnes of cargo in 1996, of which 3.5 million tonnes was metal. Its turnover in 1996 was 191.9 million litas and its operating profit was 31.2 million litas.

GCAT,GDEF,GDIP,GVIO	 Taiwan's Defence Ministry said on Tuesday it had detected routine training drills by troops on the rival Chinese mainland but saw no signs that Beijing was planning large-scale war games. &quot;Communist Chinese troops are conducting routine training drills at the moment,&quot; a Defence Ministry spokesman told Reuters by telephone. &quot;We have not detected any large-scale activities along the southeastern Chinese coast so far,&quot; he said. A report in Monday's United Daily News quoting intelligence sources as saying Beijing was planning to hold joint-forces exercises in April in coastal Fujian, Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces sent Taiwan share prices and currency tumbling. On Tuesday, the respected daily quoted mainland military sources as denying the report because China's top priorities in 1997 were Hong Kong's mid-year return from British control and a major Communist Party congress. The mainland sources warned that if Taiwan authorities continued to move towards independence or &quot;sudden variables&quot; appeared, Beijing would not rule out the possibility of taking actions against Taiwan. The United Daily News stood by its story despite the denial, again quoting unidentified Taiwan military intelligence sources as saying Beijing had completed planning for the April games. It said the manoeuvres were still &quot;on paper&quot; and Beijing would decide when, where and how to mount the war games based on the state of relations across the Taiwan strait. Taiwan's Defence Ministry said it would monitor China's movements closely. Officials in Fujian just across the Taiwan strait cast doubt on the United Daily News' report on Monday, saying they were not aware of any plans to hold war games along the coast in the near future. The report said Beijing may have in mind a new round of politically motivated manoeuvres to protest the visit to Taiwan by the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader whom China regards as a separatist. Beijing has assailed the Dalai Lama's visit -- particularly his expected March 27 meeting with Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui -- as the collusion of &quot;splittists&quot; seeking independence from China for both Tibet and Nationalist-ruled Taiwan. China held war games and missile tests near Taiwan before the island's first direct presidential election in March 1996 in what Beijing acknowledged was a bid to warn Taiwan voters not to drop a pledge to reunify with the mainland. China, which has regarded Taiwan as renegade province since a civil war split them in 1949, vows to retake the island by force if it opts for independence.

E21,E211,E212,ECAT	 New Zealand Treasurer Winston Peters said on Friday that the government's projected budget surpluses would be lower than some recent private forecasts. Peters said in a speech to Auckland businessmen that this meant some analysts' forecasts for the 1997/8 borrowing requirement were too low and that the requirement over that year would exceed that of the 1996/7 year. But the treasurer said the government still planned substantial debt reductions over the next three years as part of its fiscal programme at the heart of next Thursday's budget.   Peters said analysts had generally recognised the impact of slower growth in 1997/8 and reduced their projections compared with the official budget policy statement in March. &quot;However, these projections have not had the benefit of the knowledge of a variety of non-economic items that will also have an impact on the surplus,&quot; he said. These included: - Downward revisions in the treasury's judgement about the size of some tax bases - Lower projected surpluses from government-owned companies   - Higher debt servicing costs as a consequence of the adverse forecast changes - Technical revisions to the forecasts of the costs of New Zealand superannuation and the Government Superannuation Fund. These were apparent in the current year fiscal update and flow through into the forecast years, Peters said. - A shift in the timing of the Ngai Tahu settlement from 1996/7 to 1997/8. &quot;Together, these factors mean that projected surpluses will be lower, particularly in 1997/8, than some recent forecasts,&quot; Peters said.   &quot;As a consequence of some financial analysts' optimistic operating surplus forecasts, expectations of the government's domestic borrowing requirement for the 1997/8 financial year seem to be on the low side,&quot; Peters said. &quot;In addition, there is a larger than usual difference next year between the size of the operating surplus and the cash available for debt reduction. As a consequence, the domestic borrowing requirement for 1997/8 will be larger than the programme for the current year,&quot; he said. The government, in its latest fiscal update, forecast a NZ$3.2 billion surplus for the 1997/8 June year.   Since then, ANZ Bank economists have forecast a surplus of NZ$2.9 billion and Bankers Trust New Zealand said last week it expected a surplus of between $2.8-3.0 billion. The latest informed speculation from political sources talks of a 1997/98 surplus of a shade under NZ$2.0 billion. Peters said much of the change in its forecasts were cyclical. They did not represent a change in the government's policies, &quot;nor do they represent much ongoing impact on the government's fiscal position&quot;.   In a reiteration of comments made in parliament on Thursday, Peters told his audience the government still expected a surplus large enough to continue to provide a buffer if events turn for the worse. &quot;All this is a timely reminder why we budget conservatively and plan for surpluses.&quot; He also indicated a firm line would remain on debt reduction despite the borrowing requirement shifting.   &quot;We will be continuing to forecast substantial reductions in debt over the next three years, even after making provision for the Government's spending programme and next year's tax reductions,&quot; Peters said. Several analysts expect a programme of NZ$1.0 billion or more of new borrowing to be announced alongside the budget, split between about NZ$250 million of index-linked and the balance standard coupon bonds, probably including a new 2008/9 benchmark. --Wellington Newsroom +64-4 4734746
E12,E41,ECAT,GCAT,GJOB,GPOL	 South Africa's ruling African National Congress said on Sunday it would hold a new high-level meeting with its labour and communist allies in June to discuss continuing differences on economic policy. An ANC statement said the decision to hold further talks, following an alliance summit last week, was approved by a meeting of the party's national executive committee (NEC). It said the NEC meeting on Sunday received a statement from the labour partner in the alliance, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), on its objections to planned jobs legislation.   President Nelson Mandela's government is trying to create a more flexible labour policy as part of its macroeconomic blueprint, the Growth, Employment and Redistribution program, known as GEAR. ANC national chairman Jacob Zuma told a news conference after the NEC meeting that a general strike on May 12 threatened by Cosatu in protest at the jobs legislation, would be one of the subjects of continuing negotiations between the alliance partners. &quot;We are always hopeful that discussion between alliance partners should produce positive results,&quot; Zuma said.   &quot;I don't think the differences are that serious... I would say that it could be a question that communication had not been that thorough...&quot; Zuma said work groups would assembled to discuss economic policy more broadly. The ANC statement said a six-member committee would be set up &quot;to prepare and identify areas of disagreement for tabling at another summit in June.&quot; Workshops on the GEAR programme would be organised for members of the ANC and its alliance partners, the statement said. Political sources said that at the alliance meeting last week, attended by Mandela and his Finance Minister Trevor Manuel among others, the ANC resisted pressure from communists and labour leaders to relax fiscal discipline in favour of growth. The sources said there had been no consensus on economic policy at the summit. ((-- Anton Ferreira, Johannesburg newsroom +2711 482-1003))

GCAT,GDIP,GVIO	 Afghanistan's ousted president Burhanuddin Rabbani has won the support of Uzbek strongman General Abdul Rashid Dostum in his fight against the Islamic Taleban militia, a senior Afghan diplomat said on Tuesday. &quot;We have received a message in the morning,&quot; Masood Khalili, Afghanistan's ambassador in India, told a news conference in the Indian capital. &quot;He (Dostum) is also in the coalition of the government of President Rabbani.&quot; Asked if Rabbani and Dostum had formed an alliance, the diplomat said: &quot;I am firm they have come together.&quot; Rabbani and Dostum had been in contact with each other for the past four days, he said. Taleban has been asking Dostum, who controls six northern provinces, to stay out of the conflict that peaked last month when the hardline Islamic militia overran and captured Kabul from Rabbani's cabinet, which retreated to the north. Until recently, Rabbani's government and Dostum had been at loggerheads. But they have closed ranks against the Taleban warriors. Iranian television said on Monday night Rabbani had told its correspondent in Afghanistan that his government was regrouping against Taleban. &quot;We are organising and reorganising,&quot; Khalili said. &quot;President Rabbani has not resigned. He has not surrendered. He will strike back.&quot; Khalili said besides help from Dostum's forces in the strategic Salang valley and Tajik commander Ahmad Shah Masood's men in the Panjsher valley, Rabbani was receiving military support from Shi'ite groups at a third strategic point, the Ghorband valley. The Rabbani cabinet, which retreated to the city of Taleqan north of Kabul, still favoured a dialogue between various groups in Afghanistan and had retreated to protect civilians, he said. Khalili said Rabbani's government was willing to accept mediation by deposed King Zahir Shah, who was ousted in 1973 in the first of a series of coups that have rocked Afghanistan and lives in Rome. Khalili said some 250,000 people had left Kabul last week, mainly for the nation's eastern parts, where winters are less severe. Most of them were students or families, and some had crossed the border into Pakistan which has now been sealed, he said. &quot;To me it looks like the order of the graveyard,&quot; he said of Taleban's control over Kabul, describing the new Afghan rulers as &quot;super-fundamentalist&quot;. He repeated the Rabbani government's allegation that Pakistan had interfered in the internal affairs of Afghanistan by offering support to the Taleban. Islamabad says it is neutral in the conflict. Khalili said groups that once fought troops of the former Soviet Union as one force were divided by Pakistan's partisan support for Taleban. &quot;We won the war but lost the peace because of Pakistan,&quot; he said.
C11,C18,C181,CCAT	 French carmaker Renault has announced plans to combine into a single company its industrial interests in Brazil and Argentina. Renault will merge the 60 percent stake it owns in Renault do Brasil Automoveis into COFAL, a holding company which has a controlling interest in CIADEA, the operating business for Renault in Argentina, the company said in a statement released late on Thursday. Renault, which now has 33.4 percent of the equity of COFAL would thus become the majority shareholder, along with Surauto, a company controlled by a group of South American investors headed by Manuel Antelo. Renault said the move reflected its strategy of growth in the countries of Mercosur, the regional customs union formed by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. &quot;Renault is thus continuing in its strategy of constructing a strong and integrated centre of activities in South America,&quot; the company said. It said that it was based on &quot;the complementarity of the company's operatons in Argentina and Brazil&quot;. Cofal will still own 51 percnet of CIADEA -- the remainder is owned by the public. Antelo, chairman of Surauto, will continue as chairman and president of CIADEA. In 1996, CIADEA produced 69,000 Renault vehicles and took 20 percent of the Argentine automobile market.

GCAT,GDEF,GDIP	 Syria accused Israel on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it and said its arms purchase were only for defensive purposes. The ruling party newspaper al-Baath also said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was escalating tension against Syria to force it to drop its demand for a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, captured in the 1967 Middle East war. &quot;Suddenly a hysterical campaign is launched against Syria and its defence capabilities with the participation of Netanyahu, his generals and his media networks,&quot; al-Baath said. Israeli channel two television on Monday said Syria had tested weeks ago a long-range scud missile able to hit targets in Israeli cities with the aim of &quot;verifying the Syrian army's ability to perform an operational launch.&quot; Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Syria on Tuesday that missile tests were no way to signal a desire for peace. &quot;If Syria wants peace, the tone and style is not with missiles or weapons like that,&quot; Levy told reporters. Tension between Syria and Israel mounted after the Likud leader, elected in May, vowed not to relinquish the Golan. Al-Baath said the sudden Israeli accusations against Syria's defence capabilities were only an attempt to undermine Damascus' role in the peace process and its strategic option to exchange land for peace. &quot;Netanyahu, who shut the door to peace efforts and led the peace process to a dead end because of his extremist and arrogant policies, could not find a way out but to resort to the policy of force and threats and therefore is using any pretext to escalate tension in the region to the maximum.&quot; &quot;These crazy Israeli campaigns cannot affect the Syrian position...and are rejected as a whole,&quot; al-Baath said. The official daily Tishreen hit back by saying Israel should have its nuclear installations inspected because they were a threat to regional security before judging other countries. &quot;The failure of taking serious and effective measures against Israel's nuclear armament will encourage large scale armament in the Middle East because Israel cannot grant itself this advantage and raise hell if an Arab country dares buy defensive weapons,&quot; Tishreen said.
C15,C151,CCAT	 Kimball International Inc said Friday the gain in its fiscal first quarter earnings reflected strong sales and income gains in wood and metal office furniture, lodging furniture and electronic assemblies. Earlier, Kimball reported earnings of $0.65 a share, up from $0.40. Earnings rose in spite of reduced sales to original equipment manufacturer (OEM) television cabinet customers and continued softness in certain units within the raw materials group.   Gross margins expanded as inflationary pressures for raw materials subsided somewhat, compared with a year ago, said Douglas Habig, president. Also, the company benefited from favorable product mix shifts. During the quarter, the company recorded a $3.8 million loss on the sale of its United Kingdom-based piano key and action operation, Herrburger Brooks Plc. That was offset, however, by a tax benefit of about the same amount. The company's net cash flow totaled $26 million during the quarter. Kimball said it continues to invest internally in information technology, manufacturing capacity, and process and quality improvements to expand its business while generating returns in excess of the cost of capital. &quot;The performance gains we've made relate directly to our past investments to improve the way we design, build, and market our products and services,&quot; Habig said. &quot;Our focus on generating profit above our cost of capital--what we call economic profit--as well as on increasing Kimball's value as an enterprise, will result in enhanced share owner return.&quot; He added the company is optimistic about the current business outlook and prospects.

C31,CCAT,M14,M143,MCAT	 A sharp spike in gasoline prices at the pump this month that is echoing a move in wholesale markets during July has given rise to concerns that gasoline marketers may be engaging in price gouging. But oil and auto industry sources said prices rose last month due to a number of market-related factors including what appears to be solid demand. &quot;There is a logical explanation besides price gouging,&quot; said Mike Morrisey, an official at American Automobile Association (AAA) in charge of price surveys. But at least one New York politician is asking the state attorney general to look into the possibility that large oil companies may be engaged in price gouging. &quot;The recent increase creates the suspicion that oil companies may be engaging in price gouging,&quot; Joe Rizzo, presiding officer of the Suffolk County Legislature on Long Island, east of New York City, said in a prepared statement. He pointed out that prices in the area were up 10 cents in the last week to $1.37 a gallon, a significant price move that AAA's Morissey does not dispute. &quot;It's definitely a very significant move. A 10-cent increase in three weeks is a Gulf War type increase,&quot; Morrisey said, referring to sharp price spikes that followed Iraq's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait that ultimately led to the Gulf War in early 1991. In fact, Morrisey said prices in Michigan rose 12 cents over the last two weeks. He said that while it is still too early to tell, it is likely that prices may be higher than year-ago levels for the first time this year when AAA publishes its next monthly price survey next week. The average price of self-serve regular unleaded stood at $1.25 a gallon last Aug 20, but Morissey said it is possible prices may retreat to below those levels by the time AAA releases the new survey. During the last 10 days of July, wholesale prices on New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) rose more than 15 cents to almost 70 cents a gallon as tightening supplies joined the strong demand to create a perfect recipe for a price spike. &quot;We've had strong demand all summer, but now we have seen supplies down due to some production problems at refineries,&quot; Morrisey said, adding, &quot;It's 'Economics 101.'&quot; In particular, unexpected maintenance at a New Jersey refinery oil traders like to call the &quot;gasoline machine&quot; underpinned much of that strength in late July, sources said. Additionally, gasoline imports, a small but key source of supply to the U.S. East Coast, have been at low levels in recent weeks, due in part to strong demand in Europe, from where a good part of imported supplies come. The wholesale spike has since subsided, but sources caution that prices at the pump are always quick to rise but much slower to fall. They say that retailers, reluctant to raise prices in the beginning to prevent loss of business to competitors, often try to recap some of those losses in profit margins at the tail of the spike. -- New York Oil Desk +1 212 859 1633
C21,CCAT	 Australia's sugar cane crushing for week 15 totalled 1.906 million tonnes, up from 1.477 million in the week to September 14, growers group CANEGROWERS said. CANEGROWERS reported for crushing week 15 of the 1996 season that average commercial cane sugar (ccs) content rose to 14.61 percent from 14.49 percent the week before. The latest week brought this year's crush to 23.517 million tonnes, up from 19.788 million tonnes at the same time in 1995. Australian sugar cane crush by region for the week ended September 21 as reported by CANEGROWERS in tonnes. The 1995 crush started on June 13 and ended by December 30.

C33,CCAT	 The Atacama natural gas pipeline project led by Chile's Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA, Endesa, and CMS Energy Corp has awarded a contract for construction of two 355 megawatt power plants in northern Chile, Endesa general manager Jose Yuraszeck said. Production orders have also been filed for 925 kilometers of steel tubing for the project, which will bring Argentine natural gas over the Andes to northern Chile.   &quot;Atacama is the most important energy megaproject in Chile and it will allow the area to have cheaper electricity,&quot; he told a news conference.  The natgas project is aimed largely at fuelling Chile's booming copper mining industry. The consortium, which is owned equally by Endesa and CMS Energy, has signed the contract with GEC-Alsthom NV, a joint venture of Britain's General Electric Co Plc and France's Alcatel Alsthom, for the two plants, which are to come onstream in February 1999.   The group has awarded the steel tubing contract to Argentina's Siderca SACA, a unit of Grupo Techint, an affiliate of German firm Mannesmann AG and Stubb Corp from the U.S.. Yuraszeck declined to give details of the sums involved. GasAtacama is also close to signing deals for the supply of natural gas with Pluspetrol Energy and Astra CAPSA, said Francisco Mezzadri, CMS's director for Latin America. &quot;The contracts should be signed within a few days,&quot; Mezzadri told a news conference.   The total cost of the project has fallen to $650 million from an original budget of $900 million as it no longer includes desalinization plants and the tubing and power plant contracts were cheaper than the group had been expecting, said Yuraszeck. The project is one of three competing to supply power to the region's fast-growing mining industry. The Norgas consortium, led by the recently privatized Tocopilla power complex, is also planning a natgas pipeline. Local power generator Chilgener SA is building generator plants in northern Argentina and will bring power to Chile via a transmission line. Power demand is likely to grow at 18-20 percent a year for the next five years and then slow to around 10 percent growth annually, said Yuraszeck. Even with the sharp growth in power demand expected in the next few years as new mines come into production, the market can only support one gas pipeline project, electricity analysts have said.

E12,ECAT,GCAT,GPOL	 (From the &quot;Inside Canberra&quot; Newsletter) A sea change in political debate is emerging with the prospect of the Labor Opposition decisively moving away from the economic rationalist policies which since 1983 have been followed by the Hawke and Keating governments and by the Coalition. Senior Labor figures are prepared to shift to a far more interventionist policy approach and offer the electorate a re-industrialisation of Australia as its central policy. To do this will mean Labor will have to publicly spurn the policies of Paul Keating and his government. This will be tricky, because the opposition leadership, as Keating ministers, went along with it. But Labor believes it has no chance at the next election if it continues the same basic Treasury economic rationalist line which it pursued, and which is now being pursued by the Howard government with even more vigour. It is the failure of Labor to publicly reject its former policies and admit the failure of the Keating government which is weakening its credibitlity when it attacks the Howard budget. One senior Labor figure said to us this week of the policies of economic rationalism and free trade pursued by Keating: &quot;We always knew it was bullshit.&quot; An admission indeed. Less colourfully but more specifically, Opposition Leader Kim Beazley in an interview in The Advertiser, Adelaide (August 26) said the government must be prepared to &quot;prop up&quot; operations such as the heavily loss-making Australian National &quot;in recognition of its contribution to the nation's rail system.&quot; (It was propped up by the Keating government, but only because the election was approaching. There would have been no more propping up had Labor won the election.) Beazley said South Australia was in danger of being &quot;de-industrialised.&quot; &quot;We've got to re-establish the industrial heartland of SA,&quot; he said. There was no mention of this in Keating's day, only of glories awaiting us with APEC free trade. Lindsay Tanner, regarded as one of the best thinkers of the Left and now shadow minister for transport, told the Victorian Fabian Society recently: &quot;The Labor Government was heavily constrained by Treasury ideology.&quot; And getting to the heart of the politics of economic policy he said the Keating government's agenda of deregulation, internationalisation, multiculturalism and Aboriginal reconciliation was dominated by his generation -- the generation of the '70s. &quot;Unfortunately, much of the rest of Australia, including larger sections of Labor's base, does not share these views,&quot; he said. &quot;They no longer merely tolerate or ignore these themes; in the 1996 federal election many actively rebelled against them.&quot; (The views expressed here are those of Inside Canberra, not Reuters.) -- Inside Canberra, 61-6 273-1600
GCAT,GDIP,GENT	 Lebanon's information minister on Thursday overruled a ban on distribution of materials published in Israel and authorised the sale of a book by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu's book would help the Lebanese understand what Israel was up to, Information Minister Bassem al-Sabaa said. &quot;The book contributes to improving the knowledge and awareness of Arab and Lebanese citizens towards the Zionist and Israeli plans and uncovers the thoughts that rule behavior of the enemy prime minister,&quot; Sabaa said in a statement published in Beirut newspapers. Lebanon and Israel are officially at war despite six years of peace talks and an interior ministry ruling bars distribution of materials published in Israel. Three Lebanese and an unidentified Jordanian were charged in November with infringing the ban by importing an Arabic version of Netanyahu's book &quot;A Place Among the Nations&quot;. A prosecutor demanded up to 10 years jail for the men, who included a bookshop owner, a printing press owner and a shipping company owner. Judicial sources said on Thursday the charges would now be dropped. English and Arabic versions of books written by Netanyahu's predecessor Shimon Peres are already available in Beirut bookshops. Netanyahu came to power last May on a platform opposing Arab-Israeli peace talks on the basis of exchanging occupied Arab land for peace, which Peres and his predecessor Yitzhak Rabin had promoted.
C42,CCAT,E41,ECAT,GCAT,GJOB	 French aluminium company Pechiney has joined a long list of French companies that have announced massive job cuts, spelling possible labour unrest in the autumn, trade unions said on Friday. But the plan pleased investors, driving the share up 2.2 percent to 218 francs at 0945 GMT. Angry labour unions denounced a tough cost cutting plan at Pechiney that entails 4,000 to 5,000 jobs cuts worldwide, saying they were considering possible action. &quot;We are going to fight. But it is premature to say what form our action will take,&quot; one union source told Reuters. Labour representatives are due to meet management on September 27 to discuss the plan but are already thinking about taking action in October though no date has yet been set. Pechiney's announcement follows plans by arms-maker Giat Industries to shed 2,741 jobs and appliance maker Moulinex to cut 2,600 jobs, most of them in France. Engiineering group Alcatel Alsthom may end up shedding some 30,000 jobs worldwide under its restructuring plan, analysts estimate. On Thursday Pechiney announced that an important part of the savings generated by the Challenge cost-cuting plan would come from a 16 percent reduction in the total wage bill, with half of the savings to be found in France. The group employs 37,000 worldwide, of which 17,000 are in France. A Pechiney spokesman told Reuters that the plan may lead to &quot;4,000 to 5,000 job cuts by end-1998,&quot; In France the job reductions will come from up to 500 redundancies and 1,000 through early retirement. Use of flexible working would save 1,200 jobs.The programme will avoid relocating plants abroad where costs are cheaper and will involve the closure of one French foundry which employs 72. Labour organisations immediately reacted to the announcement with a joint statement from five trade unions denouncing the job losses as &quot;unacceptable&quot;, while the CGT union in a separate statement called on employees to organise opposition to the programme. Pechiney predicted on Thursday that provisions for its &quot;Challenge&quot; cost-cutting plan would push the group into the red in 1996. Chairman Jean-Pierre Rodier told a news conference the exact amount of provisions, which include up costs of shedding up to 1,500 jobs in France, was not yet known but would include two billion francs ($388.9 million) in restructuring costs and result in a loss for the year. The Challenge plan has identified four billion francs ($777.4 million) in cost savings to be made by the end of 1998 and is Pechiney's bid to match the profitability of its best competitors. Alongside the savings, about 3.5 billion francs will be invested in the next three years to modernise plants. Analysts said they were less concerned over possible unions unrest at Pechiney than over the levels of provisions linked to the restructuring. They had expected restructuring provisions of up to 1.5 billion instead of the two billion francs announced by Pechiney. They also said they were sceptical Pechiney could meet its &quot;ambitious&quot; four billion francs cost-savings target. ($1=5.145 French Franc)

E21,E211,ECAT,GCAT,GPOL	 Britain's new Labour government will present its first budget on Wednesday, July 2, Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) Gordon Brown said on Monday. Brown has said his first budget would be a &quot;welfare-to-work&quot; budget, with the centrepiece a &quot;windfall&quot; tax on the profits of privatised utility companies.   The tax is expected to raise three to five billion pounds which will be used to fund a programme to create work for 250,000 young and long-term unemployed people. As Brown prepares the first budget from a Labour government in 19 years, the main question in most economists' minds is not whether he will increase taxes but by how much. Brown must perform a difficult balancing act, keeping Labour's election promise not to raise the overall tax burden on ordinary people and demonstrating that the party can make a difference to unemployment and the quality of key public services -- all while keeping financial markets happy. In holding the budget on a Wednesday, Brown is breaking with recent tradition of holding them on Tuesdays. The choice of July 2 will avoid a clash with the official handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China, which Prime Minister Tony Blair is expected to attend.
C33,C331,CCAT,GCAT,GDEF,GDIP	 India and Russia signed a defence cooperation agreement on Wednesday but did not clinch a $1.8 billion warplane deal, a Russian embassy official said. The official said visiting Russian Defence Minister Igor Rodionov and Indian Defence Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav signed a pact to &quot;foster closer ties between the armed forces and periodic exchange of information on matters of military interest&quot;. But the two could not reach an agreement on the widely reported $1.8 billion sale of 40 multi-purpose Sukhoi Su-30 jets. &quot;The issue of sale of warplanes to India definitely figured in the bilateral talks but the two countries could not come down to signing the deal,&quot; the Russian official told Reuters. He declined to say if the issue was still open for future discussions or to comment further. As the former Soviet Union's main non-communist ally, India was one of Moscow's biggest arms clients. Russian President Boris Yeltsin visited India in January 1993, helping clinch a debt repayment pact covering money which New Delhi owed Moscow mainly for military purchases. Relations soured again after the United States forced Moscow to cancel a $250 million sale of cryogenic rocket engines on the grounds they could be used to build missiles. But Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov's Indian visit last March helped revive relations. During Primakov's visit, the two countries agreed to set up a &quot;hotline&quot; telephone link between New Delhi and Moscow for the leaders of the two countries to hold crisis talks.
E21,E212,ECAT,G15,G151,G154,GCAT,M12,MCAT	 A stability pact hammered out in Dublin to ensure fiscal discipline once monetary union starts, leaves much to be desired from the standpoint of German Bunds which now face the risk of higher inflation, bond market analysts said on Friday. The analysts said Bunds, which intitially were pulled higher on word the pact had been reached, face a risk of a sell-off on Monday once financial markets realise the real implications of the deal for German debt holders. &quot;This will not stop the risk of inflation,&quot; said Holger Schmieding, economist at Merrill Lynch in Frankfurt. &quot;There is no reason for Bunds to climb on this.&quot; The March DTB Bund future was up 49 basis points in late trade to 100.15, just off its high of the day. Most of the gains, however, came on the back of stronger U.S. Treasuries before the stability pact announcement. European Union finance ministers wrestled over the deal for six hours on Friday after a long session the night before to agree details of the stability pact. According to the deal, fines applied to countries that do not meet economic targets would not be levied on countries whose gross domestic product had fallen by an annual 2.0 percent rate or more. If GDP were to fall by between 0.75 and 2.0 percent, ministers would decide whether the country should be fined. Bond analysts said the climb in Bunds after the deal was annnounced was due to rapid gains in other European debt markets with high-yielding bond markets leading the way. Higher bond markets elsewhere literally pulled Bunds higher. Evidence of the Bund market's more cautious reaction came in the narrowing spread between German debt and other markets indicating that Bunds were underperforming other European bond markets. &quot;Bunds have been pulled up by the high-yielders,&quot; said Ian Ford, bond market analyst at MCM YieldWatch in London. &quot;I am concerned there will be some weakness come next week.&quot; He and others said Bunds are vulnerable because the deal was not as tough on countries showing lax fiscale disipline as had been hoped and because any progress toward EMU hints at higher inflation than Germany's already low levels. &quot;The deal was too loose for Germany's liking,&quot; Ford said. Some said the market will now closely watch the reaction of the Bundesbank which has been a vocal advocate of strong adherence to Maastricht Treaty criteria. Schmieding said the Bundesbank may not be delighted by the deal, but that the overall impression may not be all bad. &quot;The deal is not so bad that the Bundesbank will decide against cutting interest rates if it needs to,&quot; he said. --Frankfurt Newsroom + 49 69 756525

M14,M143,MCAT	 The Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI) and its related futures contract rose to three month highs Thursday, boosted by five-year highs in heating oil prices as well as gains in natural gas, live hogs and coffee. &quot;World economic growth is currently being led by the U.S., which tends to make it energy intensive, with a positive impact on agricultural commodity prices also,&quot; Goldman Sachs commodities research director Steve Strongin said.   The GSCI was up 2.87 points at 207.02 midday, after seeing a session high at 207.25, its highest level since July 17. CME October GSCI futures were up 2.50 points at 206.80, after seeing a life-of-contract high at 207.10, and the highest level on the weekly continuation chart since July. The Knight Ridder Commodity Research Bureau Index (CRB), which has a lower weighting in the energy sector, was up only 0.93 points at 245.57, while NYFE November CRB futures were up 0.50 points at 244.30.   October GSCI futures have been in an uptrend since early August and technical indicators, such as a standard nine-day relative strength indicator (RSI), show the contract is not overbought yet, closing at 55 percent Wednesday. On the weekly continuation charts, GSCI futures have been in a longer term uptrend since July last year. With the GSCI's heavy 49 percent rating in the energy sector, the rise in NYMEX November heating oil and NYMEX November natural gas futures boosted the GSCI Thursday. NYMEX November heating oil was up 1.52 cents at 73.50 cents a gallon, after seeing a life-of-contract high and new five year high on the continuation charts at 73.90 cents. But the November heating oil/crude crack spread rose further to around $6.40 a barrel, the highest levels since last winter, which may eventually encourage a move to higher distillate yields by refineries, analysts said. U.S. distillate inventories, which include heating oil, rose 1.80 million barrels to 112.3 million barrels in the latest week's data from the American Petroleum Institute (API).   The American Gas Association (AGA) reported an 84 billion cubic feet (bcf) net injection to natgas storage in the latest week, bringing the total to 2,475 bcf, but storage remains behind year-ago levels going into the winter. The large spread between natural gas prices and oil prices on an energy equivalent basis is also bullish for natural gas and should encourage fuel switching by utilities in the week's ahead, analysts said. Heating oil is trading at the equivalent of around $5.00 per mmbtu currently, compared to Gulf Coast cash natgas prices of around $2.00, analysts noted. CME December live hog futures also saw a fresh contract high Thursday at 58.80 cents a lb, extending the rally since September, though the nine-day RSI reached the overbought zone at 72 percent at Wednesday's close. Asian demand for pork is up in the third quarter from the second quarter this year, while the seasonal demand for holiday hams is ahead in the U.S., analysts said. But hog prices have yet to recover to the five year highs at 66.725 cents seen in May this year. --New York Commodities Desk, +1-212-859-1641; email: clive.mckeef@reuters.com
E12,ECAT,M13,M132,MCAT	 Kazakhstan may control its tenge currency with a crawling peg to a foreign currency or basket of currencies, the head of the central bank said on Thursday. National Bank Chairman Uraz Dzhandosov told the Mazhilis lower chamber of parliament that the central bank and government were now discussing such an arrangement, which he likened to the system now prevailing in Russia. &quot;This is similar to what in Russia is called the sloping corridor, Dzhandosov said. &quot;We have not yet taken a final decision,&quot; he added. The main advantage of a system such as the corridor would be to provide exporters with certainty about the future course of the exchange rate, he said. The interests of exporters must be taken into account because the economic recovery will be export-led, not driven by domestic demand, he said. A crawling peg allows a currency to depreciate at a slow pre-set and pre-announced rate. In Russia's version of this, the central bank announces a series of upper and lower limits within which the currency is allowed to fluctuate. Dzhandosov said the average exchange rate of the tenge was running this year at 69-70 per dollar, stronger than the originally forecast 70-71. The tenge, introduced in 1993, has depreciated gently since then except for a sharp appreciation in summer 1995 caused by capital inflows. The rate of depreciation has accelerated since mid-November, and the tenge was quoted at around 73.40 per dollar on Thursday. The central bank currently targets money supply, and exchange rate movements are geared to meeting this goal.

GCAT,GSPO	 Italian Jarno Trulli will join the Prost Grand Prix formula one team currently test driving at Magny Cours in the absence of injured Frenchman Olivier Panis, the team said on Tuesday. The 22-year-old Minardi driver, who has raced in seven grands prix this season, will test drive alongside Frenchman Emmanuel Collard and Shinji Nakano of Japan on Wednesday and Thursday at the venue for the June 29 French Grand Prix. &quot;He will be able to back the work of Shinji in preparing for the France Grand Prix where, in addition, we expect to give a new development in our Mugen-Honda engine its first run,&quot; team chief Alain Prost said. Earlier on Tuesday, the Prost team announced that Collard was starting tests at Magny Cours as they seek a replacement for Panis, who suffered multiple fractures to his legs when he crashed during Sunday's Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal. He is not expected to race again this season. Collard, a former test driver for Williams, Benetton and Tyrrell, has been linked with a future role at the Prost outfit since the start of the season. The Prost team said that while Collard would test drive this week, a decision on Panis's replacement for the French Grand Prix would not be taken until &quot;a later date&quot;.
E11,ECAT,M11,MCAT	 Wall Street, fresh from a near-record rise Tuesday, was expected to open lower on fears that a surprisingly strong GDP number may encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The Commerce Department on Wednesday reported that real Gross Domestic Product grew at an annual rate of 5.6 percent in the first quarter of 1997, a nine-year high. Alan Ackerman, markets strategist at Fahnestock  &amp; Co, said: &quot;With this number, the Fed is ready now to feel that it can consider this (a rate rise) strongly.&quot; He added, &quot;It's likely to impact the very strong rally we had yesterday and take its toll on stocks that went up too quickly. ... We may have a blue-chip round of profit-taking.&quot;
C15,C152,CCAT	 Genentech Inc president and chief executive officer Arthur Levinson said he expects 1996 earnings to be &quot;just under&quot; $1 a share, versus $1.38 last year. Speaking at the Hambrecht and Quist Healthcare Conference here, Levinson also said the company is aiming to cut research and development spending to 25 to 30 percent of revenues by 1999, from about 50 percent currently.   &quot;We have historically put 30 to 45 percent of our sales into R&amp;D and we made a deliberate decision to ramp that up to 50 percent over the last year and a half,&quot; Levinson said. &quot;Now we have decided to reduce that to 25 to 30 percent in order to put more to the bottom line.&quot; Levinson also said that while the company was excited by the Food and Drug Administration's earlier-than-expected approval of its Activase heart attack drug in a new indication for stroke patients, the drug is currently being used by only about 15 percent of eligible stroke victims.   Eligible patients are those who are hospitalized within three hours after the attack, since beyond that point the risk outweighs the benefits. &quot;There is clearly a lot of education and campaigning that has to be done (on Activase),&quot; he said.

GCAT,GDIP	 The political editor of a German newspaper has expressed regret over a reference to Britain's Foreign Secretary as &quot;the Jew Rifkind&quot;, a British member of parliament said on Monday. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung caused outrage in Britain with this reference to Malcolm Rifkind in a story last week, although Rifkind himself dismissed the phrase on Sunday as &quot;a rather silly remark by a young journalist&quot;. Greville Janner, an opposition Labour member of the British parliament and a former president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said in a statement he had discussed the matter with the paper's chief political editor, Guenther Nonnenmacher. &quot;Neither the journalist nor the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung intended to cause any offence,&quot; Janner said. &quot;Certainly, there was no antisemitic intent in the journalist's comments. Both the journalist and newspaper deeply regret the offence that was caused, and guarantee not to use the phrase in future,&quot; he added. Janner said he was pleased that &quot;this distinguished newspaper will not again use that offensive terminology&quot;. &quot;This episode shows that as we debate the future of Europe, we should be extremely sensitive to the past, including the impact of language and of epithets,&quot; Janner said.
E41,ECAT,GCAT,GJOB,GWELF	 The Zimbabwean government, in an attempt to end a three-week strike by civil servants which has paralysed essential services, offered on Wednesday to reinstate thousands of workers it fired over the stoppage. Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Florence Chitauro said in a statement anyone who failed to report to work by Wednesday would be dismissed. &quot;Notwithstanding the fact that the civil servants took part in an illegal strike, government has now resolved that all the civil servants who had been dismissed be reinstated with effect from... the 4th of September,&quot; Chitauro said. However, on Wednesday morning thousands of the strikers, who include doctors, nurses, mortuary attendants and prosecutors, streamed to a central park in the capital Harare, saying they were waiting to be addressed by their leaders on the government's climbdown. The government last week offered the strikers -- who are demanding wage rises of between 30 and 60 percent -- a 20 percent pay increase in addition to a nine percent award which the workers had rejected as inadequate when they stopped work on August 20.
GCAT,GSPO	 Rookie Jeremi Gonzalez won the pitching battle with his fellow Venezuelan and longtime idol Wilson Alvarez and Sammy Sosa hit a two-run homer as the Chicago Cubs defeated the San Francisco Giants 6-3 Thursday. Gonzalez (8-5) allowed two runs over 6 2/3 innings, yielding four hits and walking two with five strikeouts. He snapped a personal three-game losing streak and moved within two victories of becoming the first Cubs rookie to post double digits in victories since Mike Harkey in 1990. Alvarez and Gonzalez are both from Maracaibo, Venezuela. &quot;My parents told me that if I won this game I would get a gift -- a car or an apartment,&quot; Gonzalez said. &quot;The whole town shut down to watch this game on television. Wilson has been my idol and I have followed him since I was a teenager. I had total concentration. I'll never forget this game.&quot; Sosa hit his 24th homer in the fifth inning to stake the Cubs to a 3-0 lead against Alvarez, who was returning to the city where he spent his first seven seasons with the White Sox before being traded to San Francisco on July 31. The left-hander (1-1) allowed three runs and seven hits over six innings, walking two and striking out three. &quot;I threw pretty good,&quot; Alvarez said. &quot;What can I say? I wanted to throw the pitch to Sammy inside and I put it over the plate. You can't make mistakes to a hitter like that.&quot; The loss snapped the Giants' four-game winning streak and cut their lead over second-place Los Angeles to 1 1/2 games in the National League West. The Cubs' Brian McRae, who entered the game in an 0-for-10 slump, went 3-for-4 with a homer, two runs scored and a stolen base. J.T. Snow hit his 19th homer for the Giants. In Atlanta, Denny Neagle allowed just five hits over 7 2/3 innings to become the first 16-game winner in the National League and Ryan Klesko drove in a pair of runs as the Braves blanked the St. Louis Cardinals 3-0. Neagle (16-2) walked one and struck out seven to extend his career-high scoreless streak to 23 2/3 innings. He is 4-0 in his last six starts. Mark Wohlers pitched a scoreless ninth for his 27th save. Todd Stottlemyre (11-8) took the loss. In Montreal, Mike Piazza had three RBI on four hits, including a two-run homer, and Raul Mondesi and Brett Butler each drove in two runs, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 9-4 victory over the Expos. In the three-game series, Piazza was 9-for-14 with three homers and seven RBI. In Philadelphia, Rex Hudler, activated from the disabled list before the game, singled in Ricky Otero with one out in the 11th to lift the Phillies past the Houston Astros, 6-5. Hudler, who also hit a two-run homer in the seventh, had been sidelined since June 9 and underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee three days later. Philadelphia, which has the worst record in the major leagues, has won eight of its last 10 games. The Astros have dropped a season-high four straight after winning 13 of their previous 15 contests. Their lead over Pittsburgh in the Central Division shrank to four games. In Pittsburgh, Jason Kendall hit a two-run homer and five pitchers combined on a seven-hitter to lead the Pirates to a 5-1 victory over the Florida Marlins. Pirates starter Francisco Cordova was ejected with no outs in the second inning by home plate umpire Jerry Layne for hitting Moises Alou one pitch after surrendering a home run to Darren Daulton. Both benches emptied but order was restored. Pittsburgh manager Gene Lamont was later ejected by second base umpire and crew chief Joe West when he came out to protest Cordova's ejection. In New York, Carlos Baerga, making his first start since July 29, went 4-for-4 with a homer, four RBI and three runs scored, and the Mets scored six times in the seventh en route to a 12-4 victory over the Colorado Rockies. The Mets, shut out by Colorado rookie John Thomson the night before, erupted to match their second-best offensive output of the season. Mark Clark (8-7), who has been nursing a blister on the index finger of his throwing hand, went the distance, allowing eight hits and a walk with four strikeouts. In Cincinnati Brett Tomko (7-3) combined with Scott Sullivan on a four-hitter as the Reds blanked the slumping San Diego Padres 7-0. Joe Oliver and Eduardo Perez homered and Willie Greene added a bases-loaded double for the Reds, who won for just the third time in nine games. The Padres have dropped four of their last five. Tony Gwynn was 0-for-4 and is hitless in consecutive games for just the second time this season. His average fell to .384.
C13,CCAT,GCAT	 The New Jersey Turnpike Authority said Friday it would sponsor a one-day conference next week to convince commercial truckers to increase their use of the highway. Entitled &quot;Driving the Pike Again,&quot; the conference will highlight new projects and technologies being planned for the Turnpike, which connects Philadelphia to New York City. &quot;The purpose of this conference is to allow the authority to meet with and listen to its commercial customers,&quot; Turnpike Authority Chairman Frank McDermott said. &quot;We will continue to make improvements with the goal of attracting commercial traffic back to the road.&quot; Commercial vehicles represent 13 percent of total volume on the Turnpike. Raising that rate, which has declined in recent years following toll hikes, is a central element of the authority's three-year toll stabilization plan announced last December.

M14,M143,MCAT	 The Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) has a critical role in deciding the fate of a planned global alliance between the world's biggest oil exchanges, industry sources said on Friday. The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) of London confirmed on Thursday they were looking at ways to quote their crude contracts jointly on a 24-hour electronic trading system. But SIMEX could thwart IPE's ambitions. To quote the crude contracts jointly, it would need the go-ahead from SIMEX, the sources said. IPE quotes only Brent, a world benchmark crude from the North Sea. In 1995, it agreed to quote Brent also on SIMEX. But that pact included a provision that the two exchanges would both have to agree to Brent being quoted on MYMEX. &quot;SIMEX is in a very strong position to influence these talks,&quot; said a senior broker. &quot;Screen trading is the way these markets are going.&quot; In 1995, the IPE agreed to allow its Brent contract to be listed on SIMEX open-outcry market for five years. Positions could be opened in London and closed on SIMEX, or vica versa. But traded volumes in Singapore have been poor, so news of the NYMEX/IPE talks earlier this week sparked worries SIMEX was being sidelined. However, the provision in the SIMEX/IPE agreement makes that impossible, the sources said. &quot;What ever they want to do there should be consultation with SIMEX,&quot; said one source, who declined to be identified. &quot;At the end of the day, the three exchanges will put their heads together and come out with a plan which will address some of the inefficiencies and cost arrangements of trying to trade globally,&quot; the source said. Richard Ward, head of product development at the IPE, told a news conference on Thursday that NYMEX and the IPE hoped to reach an official agreement in the third quarter on how to link trading. At the same time, he said the IPE had no intention of dropping its Asian partner. &quot;We want the SIMEX agreement to succeed...Clearly we need to have the agreement of all interested parties to be able to progress this -- we do not want to end up with an adversarial relationship with any exchange.&quot; But some sources said SIMEX was only made aware of the NYMEX/IPE talks at a late stage, despite the mutual agreement concerning Brent. Elizabeth Sam, the deputy chairman of SIMEX, told Reuters on Thursday by telephone from a futures industry conference in the United States, that SIMEX had been asked to take part in the discussions. But she declined to say when SIMEX became involved. Some sources said an alliance of the exchanges was inevitable, given the economic shift to global alliances in industry in general, and should help counter the slide in traded volumes of oil futures in recent years. &quot;It makes sense to have three exchanges working together to build up volume,&quot; one source said. --Singapore Newsroom (+65 870 3081)

C17,C172,CCAT	 Kazakhstan's biggest bank, Halyk Savings Bank, plans to raise up to $100 million through a Eurobond by the year-end, a senior bank official said on Monday. &quot;By the end of this year we will issue dollar-denominated Eurobonds for up to $100 million... The maturity may be up to three years,&quot; Bahit Jolaman, a vice chairman of the bank, told a news conference. He said U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers had been mandated last Friday to lead manage the issue. &quot;Most probably, the credit rating to our bank will be given by rating agencies Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's,&quot; Jolaman told Reuters after the conference. He said the issue would not be burdensome for the bank. &quot;We can actually raise more than $200 million,&quot; he said, referring to the bank's capital adequacy. Jolaman said the money -- to be raised in the United States, Europe and &quot;probably in South East Asia&quot; -- would be lent to the Central Asian state's potentially huge oil and gas industry and non-ferrous metallurgy. &quot;I do not exclude investment in aviation, railway transport and precious metals,&quot; he added. State-run Halyk Savings Bank -- formerly the Kazakh branch of the former Soviet Union's Sberbank -- ranks first among 97 Kazakh banks according to its size and role in the economy. In its 1,400 offices nationwide the bank has accumulated 64 percent of all the accounts made by Kazakhstan's private persons. It currently employs 11,000 people. The bank's net profits soared last year to 563 million tenge from 179 million in 1995. Assets grew to 29 billion tenge from 25 billion in 1995. The government plans to set up a stock market, and around 60 companies, in sectors including oil, transport, communications and metals, have been designated by the authorities to become &quot;blue chips&quot; to attract foreign portfolio investors. Jolaman told Reuters that Halyk was also on the list. &quot;By the end of this year, 10-15 percent of the bank's shares could be brought on to the market... Other packets of shares will be offered to investors later on but by the year 2001 the controlling stake of at least 51 percent will probably be still in state hands,&quot; he said. Kazakhstan issued its debut sovereign Eurobond last year. The $200 million issue -- twice as much as originally planned one -- was organised by Dutch bank ABN AMRO Hoare Govett and snapped up by investors. It was priced to yield 9.3 percent or 3.5 percentage points above comparable U.S. Treasury notes. Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin said in an interview with Reuters last month that the government planned to raise another $200-250 million on international markets this autumn to help pay off its debts to pensioners reaching $500 million. The premier said the government was still to decide what paper to issue and in what currency. ($1=75.5600 tenge)
C31,C311,CCAT,M14,M141,MCAT	 Taiwan's economic ministry said on Wednesday that Tokyo, despite its ban on pork imports from Taiwan, had agreed to allow entry of 13,000 tonnes of frozen pork already in Japanese ports.   Talks were under way to allow shipment to Japan of 40,000 tonnes of Taiwan pork that was slaughtered and frozen before Taipei's March 20 announcement of a hog foot and mouth disease outbreak and a total pork export ban, ministry officials said. &quot;Japan will keep the 13,000 tonnes of frozen pork now waiting in Japan's customs,&quot; Weng Kuang-hwa, director of the export trade administration under Taiwan's economic ministry, told Reuters by telephone. Weng said the further 40,000 tonnes of frozen pork were still in storage in Taiwan but hoped it could be shipped to Japan despite Tokyo's March 21 ban on Taiwan pork imports.   Economic minister Wang Chih-kang had created some confusion on Wednesday by telling Taiwan television that Tokyo was considering easing its import ban, imposed to protect Japan's livestock from the highly contagious foot and mouth disease. Asked about Wang's comment, Weng said that the ban had not been lifted and that Wang was referring to the 13,000 tonnes of Taiwan pork that already had been shipped before the bans were imposed and possibly to the 40,000 tonnes already processed. &quot;Japan's import ban is still in effect,&quot; Weng said. &quot;Japan only agreed to allow that particular shipment to enter.&quot;
M13,M132,MCAT	 --------------------------- March 13------------------------ * Peso average unchanged at 26.321 ------------------------------------------------------------ The Philippine peso closed almost steady at 26.323 on Thursday from 26.322 as the Central Bank intervened heavily in the market, traders said. Dollars, triggered by the recent launch of Europeso issuances, continued to flow into the system, traders said. &quot;The Europeso generated a lot of interest back to the Philippines,&quot; a foreign bank dealer said.   As expected, the Central Bank bought dollars again from banks in the amount of $72 million to $74 million at 26.322 and 26.323, traders estimated. Market volume, however, was smaller at $169 million from $274.30 million. On Friday, dealers believe the peso may be pulled down by the interest arbitage play for the weekend.

E11,E51,E513,ECAT	 Algeria's Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia said on Sunday the country's foreign currency reserves stood at $4 billion at the end of 1996 and were proof of Algeria's improving economy. Ouyahia told the government-appointed Social and Economic National Council (CNES) that the reserves would enable the country to avoid a third rescheduling for its foreign debt of more than $30 billion. The prime minister said there were other figures that showed that Algeria's macro-economic performance was strengthening. &quot;I cite also the volume of the debt service which was to have been 42 percent at the end of the year but which finally reached only 32 percent,&quot; he said in his speech carried by the official Algerian news agency APS. Ouyahia also pointed to inflation falling to 16.5 percent at the end of 1996 compared with 29 percent at the end of 1995, and a fall in bank interest rates to 15 percent from 18.5 percent. The government forecast more easing in this rate in 1997, Ouyahia said. The foreign currency reserves level for 1996 was a record high. The previous high was in 1981 when Algeria piled up about $3.5 billion, thanks to exceptional crude oil prices because of the Gulf War between Iran and Iraq. This year's currency reserves were double Algeria's reserves of $2 billion in 1995. The government had said that Algerian oil prices hovered around an average of more than $20 per barrel this year compared to a targeted $17.90 per barrel in the government budget for 1996. Ouyahia said Algerians should know that the growth recorded did not, however, &quot;rest solely on the hydrocarbon sector but also on agriculture and building, despite these two sectors knowing many difficulties.&quot; Officials have said that Algerian oil and gas exports this year accounted for more than 94 percent of the North African OPEC member's foreign earnings.

GCAT,GENT,GPRO	 British actor Sir John Gielgud was given one of the country's highest honours on Monday when Queen Elizabeth appointed him a member of the Order of Merit. Buckingham Palace said Gielgud, 92, would become the 24th member of the Order, which is bestowed as a personal gift by the queen to people who have made exceptional contributions to the arts, science and the armed forces. The Order, founded in 1902 by King Edward VII, is limited to 24 members. Gielgud fills the vacancy created by the death of Sir Frank Whittle, inventor of the jet engine, in August 1996. Gielgud, who was knighted in 1953, has had a long and distinguished acting career stretching over 75 years.
GCAT,GREL	 The turnout for Pope John Paul's visit to Paris next week, coinciding with a Roman Catholic youth festival, could fall far short of expectations, worried organisers said on Wednesday. &quot;The number one question is whether there will be as much public interest as there was during the pope's last visit,&quot; said a church official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Monsignor Michel Dubost, chief organiser of the church's World Youth Days set for August 18-24 in Paris, told a news conference that as many as 500,000 people might attend a papal mass to be given on August 24 in western Paris. A few days earlier, organisers had said that as many as 650,000 people would attend. &quot;Frankly, I have no idea,&quot; Dubost said when pressed by reporters on what the turnout would be. A week ahead of the pope's arrival on August 21, with Paris in the grip of a sweltering heat wave, there is little evidence of a swell of enthusiasm for his sixth visit to France. On the other hand, there is little sign of the angry demonstrations that preceded his last visit in September 1996 when thousands protested against state aid for his activities in France, where a 1905 law separates church from state. Officials acknowledge that far fewer young people than originally forecast have signed up to attend the youth festival and fewer families than expected have signed up to house the youths during the four-day celebration. Organisers originally predicted 600,000 &quot;young people&quot; -- defined by the church as anywhere from 17 to 35 years old -- would pour into the French capital for the festivities. A few months later, that figure was revised downward to 300,000. By this week, officials were putting the number at about 220,000 young people, with several hundred thousand adults expected to fill out the crowd for a Saturday evening event and a Sunday mass at the Longchamp race course in west Paris. At the Saint-Jean church in Paris' 18th district, a poster asking volunteers to house young visitors discloses that the goal was to identify 700 hosts. So far only 150 have signed up. Dubost acknowledged fund-raising has also been a problem. &quot;We didn't really handle it very well,&quot; he told Reuters. With a budget of 250 million francs ($40 million), organisers obtained donations from just 80 of 300 businesses contacted for help, he said. About a million francs ($160,000) was expected to come from souvenir sales, but it was too early to say how that effort was going, said youth festival spokesman Jean-Guillaume Boniface.
GCAT,GDIS	 At least 13 people were killed and about 20 injured when a train and a bus collided at a railway crossing in South Korea on Monday, a police official said. The rear of the bus, which was carrying up to 50 people, was struck by the train as it drove over the tracks in the southwestern city of Namwon, the local police official said by telephone.   The train was heading for Seoul from the southern city of Sunchon when it struck the public bus, the official said. &quot;The collision took place at around 9.00 a.m. (0000 GMT). The city bus was full as it was market day in Namwon,&quot; he said. No foreigners were among the casualties, he added.

C11,CCAT	 Reutech Systems, part of the Reunert Ltd group, said on Wednesday it had commenced talks with Italy's Alenia Difesa to &quot;explore various common areas of business interests&quot;.   Reutech said in a statement that Alenia was part of the Finmeccanica group, a leading player in Italy's aerospace, helicopter, defense, energy, transportation and automation market. Reutech said it shared interests with Alenia in radar systems, avionic systems, gun control/ordinance and logistic support engineering. It gave no further details on the talks. It said the two firms recently reached an agreement at the IDEX'97 military exhibition in Abu Dhabi that Reutech would be its exclusive representative for naval electronic warfare support in South Africa.

C17,C172,CCAT	 Ispat Mexicana's 10-3/8 percent bond due March 2001 is a better buy than other Mexican Eurobonds with a similar maturity, said ING Barings in a report. &quot;They have done a really good job, and this is what the group is known for, buying companies that are in a distressed operational situation and turning them around,&quot; said ING Barings' head of Latin America Corporate Debt Research, Anne Milne. The company said that at a spread of 433 basis points over U.S. Treasuries, the bond is trading 25 to 100 basis points wider than bonds with similar maturities. &quot;We believe that the bond can tighten to 350 basis points over (U.S. Treasuries) by year-end,&quot; it said. Ispat Mexicana was purchased by the Ispat Group of India in 1992 from the Mexican government.

C11,CCAT	 Dutch chemicals group Akzo Nobel NV said late on Tuesday it had agreed with China's Wuxi Taihi Ltd to prepare a joint venture in industrial polyester fibres in the city of Wuxi near Shanghai. &quot;We expect the joint venture to come together in April 1997,&quot; Akzo board member Friedrich Froehlich told journalists. Wuxi Taihi is China's leading industrial polyester fibres producer with annual capacity of 9,000 tonnes (valued at an estimated 80 million guilders), but it wanted Akzo's know-how to help it expand to 15,000-20,000 tonnes by 2000, he said. China's total output of these fibres was currently 20,000 tonnes, but this would expand rapidly to around 80,000 tonnes in the years to come on the back of the emerging automobile industry which uses the fibres for tyres, Froehlich said. &quot;Wuxi is prepared to accept that Akzo will take 60 percent of the shares in the joint venture,&quot; he said. Akzo produces roughly 100,000 tonnes of industrial polyester fibres a year, 40,000 tonnes of which in Europe. &quot;The Chinese output will come on top of that,&quot; Froehlich said, describing this type of fibre as one of Akzo's more lucrative yarns, generating 25 percent of Akzo fibre sales. The Dutch group is currently struggling with its fibres business unit, which is markedly less profitable than its other businesses -- chemicals, coatings and pharmaceuticals -- due to cut-throat price competition with emerging east European rivals. One the main victims is Akzo's viscose textiles. The company is carrying out plans to transfer labour intensive processing activities from German and Dutch plants to Gorzow in Poland. &quot;Labour costs in Poland are around one-tenth of those in Holland or West Germany and one-fifth of those in East Germany and Britain,&quot; chairman Cees van Lede said. Van Lede said that Akzo needed to cut costs dramatically and thus improve profitability to make it worthwile continuing viscose production. &quot;If we don't act, more efficient producers will take over our market share. We need to restructure our business,&quot; he said. The reason behind Akzo expanding in China was not so much a low-wages decision, but that it was following its German and U.S. rivals, as well as the automobile industry, into Asia, Froehlich said. -- Lucas van Grinsven, Amsterdam newsdesk +31 20 504 5000

C15,C152,C31,CCAT	 The Federation of Finnish Forest Industries' new chairman Juha Niemela said on Wednesday he expected no clear signs of an upturn before February. Niemela is also CEO of UPM-Kymmene, Europe's biggest forest industry group. &quot;Most probably we won't see very good signs before, say, February,&quot; Niemela told Reuters after a news conference at the federation's autumn meeting. His remarks came after the federation issued a report headlined &quot;Upturn ahead&quot; which said an increase in European growth was expected but that prospects were still uncertain. &quot;In the normal case the paper industry starts to live strongly again in February,&quot; Niemela said, but added that the outlook was still uncertain and that prospects for the Finnish industry hinged on trends in Finland's key trading partners. &quot;The forecasters betrayed us this year,&quot; he said. &quot;They forecast about double the growth that is now materialising. Again there are ... good forecasts, but let's hope this time that they are right.&quot; &quot;We cannot determine better than the experts,&quot; Niemela said referring to the general economic outlook. He also declined to predict price trends for forest industry products. -- John Acher, Helsinki newsroom +358-9-6805 0245

GCAT,GDIS	 A bushfire near the west Australian city of Perth has forced the evacuation of hundreds of people from their homes and a prison, razed buildings and destroyed forest and farmland. Firemen have contained the blaze about 60 km (38 miles) east of Perth but a Bush Fires Board spokesman told Reuters on Saturday it would be at least another three days before the area could be declared safe. &quot;There is a heck of a lot of work to be done today,&quot; said Nobby McManus, the board's duty officer. &quot;We are hoping to take advantage of better weather conditions,&quot; he added. McManus did not say what caused the fire, which broke out on Friday afternoon, spreading quickly in hot and windy conditions. The fire destroyed about 105 square kilometres (40 square miles) of forest and farmland, he said. About 150 prisoners at Wooroloo Prison Farm and 300 workers at a nearby abattoir were evacuated. Hundreds of residents of the community of Wundowie were also evacuated and spent the night in a local hall. Perth has experienced its hottest New Year on record this year with temperatures ranging from 42 degrees Celsius (108 degrees Fahrenheit) on January 1 to 39 degrees Celsius on Friday.
GCAT,GCRIM,GVIO	 Israel began the release on Tuesday of Palestinian women prisoners as part of its peace agreements with the PLO, witnesses said. A car left Hasharon prison in central Israel with the first of the prisoners to be freed: Lamya Maarouf, 32, a Brazilian citizen. Israeli and Palestinian officials said she would be deported to Brazil. Israel has said it will free on Tuesday 31 Palestinian women, including women involved in attacks against Jews. Maarouf was arrested in 1986 for driving a car in which Israeli soldier David Manos was kidnapped. Manos was killed and Maarouf was sentenced to 25 years in jail. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, paying hospital visits in the north to soldiers wounded in Lebanon, said the promise to free the women -- two of whom were convicted of murder -- was made originally by the previous Labour government. &quot;This is a great contribution to the peace process,&quot; Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said in the West Bank town of Ramallah, where he planned to greet 27 of the women. PLO official Hisham Abdel Razek said that after the release one Palestinian female would remain behind bars in Israel -- a 15-year-old arrested two weeks ago trying to stab an Israeli soldier. He said 28 of the women were convicted of security offences and three were jailed for criminal activity unrelated to the Israeli-Arab conflict.
GCAT,GCRIM,GDIP	 The State Department said on Tuesday it was awaiting an investigation by New York City police after Russia demanded an apology from Washington over an incident in which a U.N. diplomat was allegedly beaten and arrested. &quot;We are obviously aware of this incident (and) are in close contact with the New York Police Department, which is conducting an investigation,&quot; John Dinger, a State Department spokesman, told reporters. &quot;The Department of State takes any incident of that type seriously. We will watch the investigation as it develops closely,&quot; he said. Russia said earlier on Tuesday that police had beaten and arrested one of its diplomats in New York and demanded an apology from Washington. A Foreign Ministry statement from Moscow said the first secretary of Russia's permanent representation at the United Nations was dragged from his car and beaten by police on Dec. 29 despite showing his identification. It said police broke diplomat Boris Obnosov's hand, smashed his glasses and tore his clothes before handcuffing him and taking him to a police station where he was held for 30 minutes. The New York Times, citing a police report, said Obnosov and a Belarus diplomat were drunk and abusive and fought with police officers who were ticketing cars parked too close to a fire hydrant. Dinger said Washington had been in contact with Moscow about the incident but refused to give details. The United States had not apologised for the incident, and it was unknown if it would until the police investigation was completed, he said. New York police said on Tuesday officers pulled the Russian from his car because he appeared intoxicated and refused to show his driver's license. They said the Belarus diplomat then jumped out and punched one of the policemen. Once their identities were confirmed by federal officials, the charges were voided, a police official said. Diplomats and other employees of foreign embassies in the United States are obligated to abide by U.S. law but under the 1961 Treaty of Vienna they have diplomatic immunity from prosecution. U.S. officials said that if a diplomat committed a minor offence, the infraction was usually played down and the incident ended there. But in the case of a serious offence, like a felony, the State Department asks the foreign government involved to waive immunity so the diplomat can be tried in U.S. courts. If the foreign government refuses, and Washington believes there is probable cause that the diplomat is guilty of the offence, then the United States asks the diplomat to leave the country and is prohibited re-entering.
C13,CCAT,GCAT,GDIS	 Korean Airlines (KAL ), one of whose jets crashed on Wednesday with heavy loss of life, is a signatory to an agreement scrapping limits on accident compensation, the global airline body IATA said on Thursday. But a spokesman told Reuters KAL had not yet advised IATA whether it was ready to implement the agreement, which airlines can only operate once they have the approval of their national governments and their insurers. The spokesman, Tim Goodyear, said 90 international carriers including major European and North American airlines as well as many Asians had now signed the 1996 accord, the Inter-Carrier Agreement on Passenger Liability. Of these, 55 had so far also signed an additional accord on measures to implement the agreement -- which replaces the 1927 Warsaw Convention -- by getting the government and insurance green light. &quot;KAL has not yet informed IATA whether it is able to implement the agreement or not,&quot; Goodyear said. Airlines normally discuss policy renewal with their insurance companies in November, and new terms go into effect the following January. In Wednesday's crash on the U.S. island of Guam in the north Pacific, 27 people survived out of a total of 254 on board a KAL Boeing 747 on a flight from Seoul. If KAL were in a position to implement the agreement, it would shortly begin discussions with survivors and the relatives of the dead on what the accord says should be reasonable and just compensation payments. Under the Warsaw Convention, airlines were restricted to ceilings varying from region to region on what they could pay out. Until last year, these ranged from $75,000 in the United States to $150,000 in Europe and $350,000 in Australia. To obtain more, people injured in airline accidents or relatives of the dead had to engage in costly court proceedings often stretching out over months or years to prove negligence by the company involved. Many airlines, faced with the rapidly escalating cost of litigation especially in the United States, had also chafed at the old rules and pushed for a change. Goodyear said that airlines that had notified IATA they were able to implement the new accord included major European carriers like Austrian Airlines, Finnair, KLM, SAS and Swissair as well as Malaysian Airlines in Asia. JAL Japan Airlines was a pioneer in pushing for a new agreement and has been implementing its provisions since last year. -- Robert Evans, Geneva Newsroom +41 22 733 38 31
E12,ECAT	 The Australian government's favourable inflation outlook and a so-far only modest economic recovery indicated a need for another interest rate cut, according to an industry briefing paper released on Friday. A Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia economic briefing paper on interest rates said lower inflation and a stronger Australian dollar had largely offset advantages flowing from last year's three interest rate cuts. It said of the total 150 basis point cut in rates last year, only about 30 to 60 points remained to stimulate economic activity.   &quot;The review of interest and exchange rate developments canvassed here suggests that there is no case for halting the series of nominal rate cuts,&quot; the paper said. &quot;Only a minor amount of stimulus has been imparted to date, which in turn is being offset by the short-term effects of fiscal austerity.&quot; The paper said its review suggested that Australian monetary policy was still producing real cash interest rates that were more appropriate to buoyant Asian economies than the &quot;fragile&quot; Australian economy.   &quot;Most other OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) are running substantially lower real cash rates,&quot; it said. The paper said further rate cuts would also eliminate the nominal interest differential with the United States. &quot;That would be appropriate in view of lower inflation here and the contrast between excess capacity in Australia and full employment there,&quot; it said. On Tuesday, the Australian government revised down its forecast for underlying inflation to 2.0 percent for the fiscal year to June 30, 1997.   In its August budget, it had forecast underlying inflation of 2.75 percent for the 1996/97 year. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut its overnight cash rate three times last year -- in July, November and December -- by 50 basis points each time. The overnight cash rate currently stands at 6.0 percent. -- Canberra Bureau 61-6 273-2730
C12,C13,C15,CCAT,GCAT,GCRIM	 Piracy cost companies that produce computer software $13.1 billion in lost revenue during 1995, two trade groups said Wednesday. &quot;The world's trouble spots continue to be in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, with 21 countries having piracy rates of 90 percent or more,&quot; said a report prepared by the Software Publishers Association and Business Software Alliance. Robert Holleyman, president of the Business Software Alliance, said in a statement: &quot;Global piracy losses -- more than $13 billion -- exceed the combined revenues of the 10 largest personal computer software companies.&quot; The dollar loss estimates were up from the $12.2 billion in 1994 because of the spreading use of computers worldwide. But the &quot;piracy rate&quot; declined from 49 percent to 46 percent, the report said. Using a complex formula, the two trade groups estimated the amount of software that would have been sold without piracy, then contrasted it to actual sales to arrive at piracy rates in countries around the world. The survey found the United States had the lowest piracy rate, at 26 percent, but so many personal computers that the dollar loss of $2.9 billion was beyond that of any other nation. Nonetheless, its piracy percentage rate was down 5 percent from a year earlier. Vietnam had the highest rate of software piracy, at 99 percent, followed by El Salvador, China, Oman and Russia, which were at 94 percent or higher. Australia, Britain, New Zealand and Germany all had rates below 42 percent. Japan had a rate of 55 percent, down 11 percent over 1994, and Korea, 76 percent, up 1 percent from the previous year. To complete the survey, the two trade associations surveyed their members and determined the number of personal computers and the amount of software sold in each country.

BP agreed to sell 36,000 tonnes CIF Sonbong, North Korea during Juen 19-28, at $122.90 per tonne, KEDO's broker International Services Corp said. LG-Caltex Oil Corp agreed to sell 22,000 tonnes FOB Yocheon, South Korea during June 15-18 at $113 per tonne, with freight to Nampo and Songrim, North Korea of $14.90 per tonne.   Petro Diamond agreed to sell 22,000 tonnes FOB Okinawa, Japan during June 27-29, at $110.25 per tonne, with freight at $16.90 per tonne. KEDO had tendered to buy a total of 150,000 tonnes for June and July, but it made no purchase for July. International Services Corp said KEDO expected to retender for its July requirement but did not yet know when it would seek new bids. KEDO, an organization created to ensure that North Korea freezes its nuclear weapons program, has agreed to supply the country with 500,000 tonnes of fuel oil annually.

C42,CCAT,E41,ECAT,GCAT,GJOB	 A strike by public transport workers disrupted buses, trams and underground railways in provincial French cities on Thursday as part of a union drive for shorter working hours and early retirement. The independent Force Ouvriere, the Communist-led CGT and local unions staged the 24-hour stoppage that hit cities including Bordeaux, Strasbourg and Marseille, to push for a cut in the working week to 35 hours from 39 and retirement at age 55 instead of 60. &quot;At 55 years old, a bus driver is worn out by work. We should make space for the unemployed,&quot; said Alain Chuffart, a CGT transport leader in northern France. Bus drivers in the southwestern city of Toulouse, already on strike for 11 days over similar demands, continued their action. Paris was unaffected because transport workers already have the benefits the strikers are demanding. France has been hit by sporadic unrest in recent months. Truck drivers won the right to retire at 55 last year after a 12-day strike, encouraging copycat actions in the name of cutting near-record unemployment of 12.7 percent. Roger Poletti, head of FO's transport branch, said protests could harden if no negotiations were launched. &quot;I get the impression that now we are the victims of blackmail by the bosses.&quot; &quot;I have asked the transport and labour ministries to put pressure (for talks to start). Otherwise, we will move to tougher protests,&quot; Poletti told reporters. The strike was strongly followed in southern cities including Montpellier and Perpignan. In Bordeaux, almost no buses were running and pickets were stationed outside depots. In the north, buses and trams were paralysed in Lille, but the two lines of the Metro underground railway were working. The eastern city of Strasbourg was also hard hit. In Lyon, France's second largest, only about 20 percent of workers were on strike. All bus and Metro lines were running, but with long delays. Meanwhile, France's national railways got back to normal after the second strike in a week had only limited impact on traffic on Wednesday. Workers were trying to force the government to backtrack on plans to reform state railways. In a separate protest, police ejected some 60 teachers on short-term contracts from the rector's offices in Paris's Sorbonne University. The teachers, whose contracts have been terminated by the Education Ministry, had been occupying the offices since Wednesday.
C24,C33,CCAT,GCAT,GDIP	 The South Korean government could find it tough to secure money to finance nuclear plants in North Korea if Pyongyang accepts nuclear waste from Taiwan under a controversial deal, a senior Seoul official said on Monday. Deputy Foreign Minister Song Young-shik stressed that Seoul was committed to footing the bulk of the multi-billion-dollar bill for the nuclear plants but parliament could still oppose the move. &quot;If a large amount of nuclear waste is allowed in the Korean peninsula...we are worried that this will have a negative impact when we seek public support and parliamentary approval for the huge project cost,&quot; he told reporters. Taiwan's refusal to scrap a contract shipping up to 200,000 barrels of nuclear waste to the impoverished North has enraged many South Koreans. South Korea has no verification North Korea could store the waste safely and that it is concerned about nuclear contamination of the peninsula. Taiwanese Vice-President Lien Chan on Saturday reaffirmed Taipei would not intervene in the waste shipment, saying it was a lawful, safe business deal with no moral issue involved. The deal was signed by state-run Taiwan Power Co and a North Korean agency on January 11. Song said although the main purpose of providing nuclear plants to the Stalinist North was to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, environmental concern had also been factored in when Seoul decided to support the project. Under a landmark $4.5 billion nuclear deal between North Korea and the United States in 1994, Pyongyang would receive two light-water reactors and interim energy supplies in exchange for the North abandoning its suspected nuclear weapons programme. Modern light-water reactors produce little of the weapons-grade plutonium needed to make nuclear weapons. South Korea has since promised to bear most of the project's cost. &quot;The South Korean people are paying for the reactors and the National Assembly must consent all funds towards them,&quot; Song said. &quot;The Taiwanese side has a dangerous perception that if it pays enough money it can export whatever amount of nuclear waste to a third country without any due consideration of the moral, humanitarian and environmental aspects of the matter,&quot; he said. But Song denied local media reports that Seoul would take retaliatory measures if Taipei went ahead with the shipment. &quot;I hope the situation will not be pushed to the extreme,&quot; he said. Protests continued in Seoul on Monday over the nuclear waste deal. Jang Won, leader of environmental group Green Korea, was on his sixth day of a hunger strike against the deal. Jang was expelled from Taiwan along with six other South Korean activists on Thursday after clashing with supporters of the shipments outside Taiwan Power's headquarters. Another South Korean anti-nuclear delegation, which includes four members of parliament, is due to return to Seoul later on Monday after a four-day visit to Taiwan. Members of Jang's group staged their sit-in protest for the fourth consecutive day on Monday outside the Taiwanese trade representative's office. Taiwan has no diplomatic ties with North or South Korea, both of which recognise Beijing.

C15,C152,CCAT	 Shares in Olivetti jumped on Friday after the troubled group promised to sell its personal computer business by the end of the year but the jury was still out on whether it could regain its former lustre, analysts said. Shares in the information technology group were 6.24 percent higher at 550 lire at midsession in Milan as investors snapped up a stock which has been on a roller-coaster ride in recent weeks. Financial analysts who attended a presentation by chief executive officer Roberto Colaninno in Milan on Thursday said they were impressed by his determination to turn round the business but worried by plans to cut a stake in a mobile phones venture, seen as a future money-spinner. Colaninno told the analysts he planned to divest Olivetti's ailing PC business and other interests by the end of this year, thereby raising some 800 billion lire ($526 million). A further 400 trillion lire would be obtained from more asset sales in 1997, said Colaninno in his first presentation to the financial community since taking over. He also promised to return the group to profitability by 1998. Colaninno said Olivetti intended to sell an eight percent stake in Omnitel Sistemi Radiocellulari to Germany's Mannesmann but this would not affect Olivetti's control over the company. Omnitel is a consortium led by Olivetti which owns a 70 percent controlling interest in Omnitel Pronto Italia, a fast-growing mobile phone business. A Milan-based stockbroker, who asked not to be named, said he estimated Olivetti could raise 400 billion lire from the sale of the eight percent Omnitel stake alone. Olivetti would still retain more than 50 percent of Sistemi Radiocellulari. &quot;Investors see this as selling part of the family jewels,&quot; said the broker. &quot;Omnitel is the reason why many shareholders bought Olivetti and they would rather they raised the equivalent amount by selling something else. &quot;People believe it (Omnitel) is the part of the business that will increase in value most and yesterday they found out Olivetti is weakening its stake,&quot; the broker added. Olivetti, which has not made a profit since 1990, says that its new mission is to become a big player in the thriving telecommunications market while winding down its once profitable interests in PCs and other areas. The group will still have to rely on its office equipment business, Lexikon, and its computer systems and services subsidiary -- both of which face declining profit margins -- to generate income in the years ahead, analysts said. The fast-growing Omnitel, which has signed on 560,000 subscribers to its GSM digital mobile phone service in less than a year, is not expected to turn a profit until 1998. Olivetti is believed to have come under strong pressure from its bank creditors, who are believed to be alarmed by escalating debts, to sell assets. On Friday, company executives in London, where Colaninno gave another presentation to local analysts, said the group hoped to cut net debt to two trillion lire at the end of 1996 from 2.4 trillion at end-August. Colaninno was appointed CEO last month after weeks of chaos which saw former chairman Carlo De Benedetti resign and a former director general, Renzo Francesconi, challenge the integrity of the group's first-half results. This resulted in a plunge in Olivetti's share price, which was halted when Colaninno stepped in to replace Francesco Caio, who ran the company for less than three months. $=1,520
C13,CCAT	 Brazil's government will probably send Congress in November a new version of a bill regulating the opening of the country's gas and oil industries, said lower house deputy Eliseu Resende. &quot;We are holding public hearings to see what investors and politicians want to change. The government is likely to send the new version by November,&quot; said Resende, a Liberal Front Party (PFL) deputy who is drawing up a new bill for the lower house's Petroleum Committee. An older version of the bill was seen offering privileges to state monopoly Petrobras. For example, under the old draft, Petrobras would automatically win any tender to develop oil and gas fields if its proposals were competitive with bids from private companies. Resende said his bill would seek to change the Petrobras bias and include changes to rules for importing petroleum derivatives. It would also give more power to the National Petroleum Agency, which would act as a regulatory body for the entire sector. Resende said public hearings would end in October. -- Romina Nicaretta, Sao Paulo newsroom, 5511 2324411

C11,C24,CCAT	 The China Minsheng Banking Corp, China's first privately run bank under communist rule, is aiming to expand to booming cities in the east and south, the China Daily Business Weekly said on Sunday. Minsheng would open branches in eastern Shanghai and southern Guangzhou by the end of this year, the newspaper quoted bank president Tong Zengyin as saying. The bank would also open three sub-branches in Beijing, Tong said. The bank now has two branches, both in Beijing. Minsheng was looking to move into other regions such as Chengdu, capital of the southwestern province of Sichuan, or coastal cities, the newspaper quoted other bank officials as saying. &quot;The bank will definitely fulfill its goal of increasing its financial capital to 5.0 billion yuan with deposits of 3.5 billion yuan during its first year of operation,&quot; it quoted Tong as saying. The bank, set up in January, had a start-up capital of 1.38 billion yuan, it said.

C15,C152,CCAT	 Fortune Brands Inc said Wednesday it continues to expect 13-15 percent earnings per share growth in 1997, excluding restructuring costs. It said its forecast compares with original pro forma primary and fully diluted earnings per share for the full year 1996 of $1.32 and $1.30 per share, respectively. Thomas Hays, chairman and chief executive officer of the international consumer products company, said the earnings per share outlook for the year &quot;remains unchanged and continues to be positive.&quot;   The company expects another solid gain for the third quarter, Hays said, as the company released strong ssecond quarter results. Hays said the earnings per share growth target is not dependent on large share repurchases. He noted, however, that at the company's board meeting on July 29, &quot;we will recommend instituting a systematic buyback program to cover stock option exercises.&quot;  The program is expected to be in the range of 2.0 million shares a year, he said. He said the company has made minor adjustments to its pro forma earnings calculations. The calculations, which previously assumed the repurchase of 10 million shares, have been revised to assume the buyback of 2.5 million shares. He said the impact on pro forma EPS for the second quarter and the first half of 1996 was negligible and the impact on proforma primary and fully diluted EPS for the full year 1996 is a reduction of two cents to $1.30 and $1.28, respectively.

GCAT,GDEF,GDIP	 Taiwan will resume live-fire missile practice into the sea this month after suspending the drills last year to avoid exacerbating tensions with its rival China, defence officials said on Monday. The army's missile command will fire into the open sea from a base at the northern town of Tamsui starting on March 12, the officials told Reuters. The exercises, which are usually not made public, were suspended in March 1996 shortly after China staged war games off Taiwan, another ministry official told Reuters. Held around the time of Taiwan's first presidential elections and after president Lee Teng-hui enraged Beijing by visiting the United States in June 1995, the exercises were aimed at intimidating the island for what it saw as moves to promote independence. China, which has viewed Taiwan as a rebel-held province since the Nationalists fled there after losing a civil war to Beijing's communists in 1949, has threatened to attack Taiwan if it tries to declare independence. Taiwan decided to suspend all large-scale military drills from March 1996 to avoid a misunderstanding with China, the official said. Officials brushed off the political implications of the drills, saying in particular they had nothing to do with the death of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Taiwan's military forces were put on alert after Deng died on February 19. &quot;They are merely routine practices, strictly for training purpose,&quot; a ministry official said. The official said the timetable and location of the practices were published in several major newspapers, including the ruling Nationalist Party's mouthpiece, the Central Daily News. Locally developed Sky Bow missiles and targeted planes would be used during the drills. The defence ministry did not plan to test the 200 anti-missile Patriot missiles it has ordered from the United States, a military source said.
C21,CCAT	 One day after Tele-Communications Inc succumbed to customer pressure and reinstated Viacom Inc's VH-1 music video channel to some of its cable television systems, rock stars on Wednesday thanked fans for their support but were careful not to gloat. &quot;Cleary the voice of the people matters. I think this is a testament to the power of music, to the power of democracy, to the power of consumers,&quot; rock musician Don Henley said at a news conference initially called to protest VH-1's removal from several of TCI's cable systems.   &quot;Especially I want to thank TCI for listening to those voice,&quot; Henley said. Henley appeared with John Mellencamp, rising music star Jewel and Tony Rich. TCI said late Tuesday that it had received hundreds of telephone calls from customers and that it had reviewed its decision to cut the music video channel, owned by Viacom Inc. &quot;We're not gloating,&quot; said VH-1 president John Sykes, &quot;We were simply very thankful.&quot; In December, TCI said it would replace several channels on some of its systems, citing viewer interest.   About two million VH-1 viewers were affected when the channel was cut by TCI systems in Colorado, Portland, Ore., Hartford, Conn., and Lexington, Kentucky. About 700,000 viewers of VH-1's sister music channel MTV were also affected when that channel was dropped from some systems. TCI's decision to drop VH-1, aimed at an older audience than MTV, comes at a time when music sales are less than robust and the industry's outlook uncertain. &quot;We were all concerned about it,&quot; Henley said, adding that music video channels play a key role in marketing music. Sykes said TCI officials late Tuesday telephoned Viacom to inform it that both music channels would be restored. Earlier this month TCI agreed to put MTV back on its cable system in Grand Junction, Colorado, after a college student collected signatures on a petition in protest. Sykes declined to disclose how much TCI, which recently announced layoffs and cost cutting, paid Viacom per subscriber other than to say &quot;it's pennies.&quot;  He said the reinstatement of the music channels did not involve any renegotiating of contracts.

M14,M142,MCAT	 Prices on Istanbul's gold exchange ended mixed due to a weaker Turkish lira on Friday and volume was little changed ahead of the weekend, dealers said. Gold closed at $386.20 an ounce, down $0.75 from Thursday due to easing prices in Europe. In lira terms, the close was 4,250 higher at 1,088,750 lira per gram due to the lira's losses against the dollar. Traded volume was 833 kilos compared to 800 on Thursday. &quot;There was little demand from the free market because of expectations for gold to drift lower in international markets. It must also be noted that the lively summer season (in Turkey) is coming to an end,&quot; said a free market dealer. Morning volume was 483 kilos, followed by 350 kilos in the afternoon. Almost 60 percent of the total trade was in lira terms due to the lira's weakness. Exchange members import gold and prefer to sell it in lira terms when the lira depreciates faster. --Istanbul newsroom +90-212-2750875
GCAT,GCRIM,GPOL	 An Atlanta court will begin to hear oral arguments on Dec. 4 in former Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega's appeal against his drug and racketeering conviction, an attorney for Noriega said Thursday. Jon May, who defended Noriega along with Miami attorney Frank Rubino, told Reuters Atlanta's 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals would also hear Noriega's case against the denial earlier this year of his motion for a new trial. Noriega is serving a 40-year prison sentence for his 1992 conviction on drug and racketeering charges. His lawyers had argued at a March hearing that the original guilty verdict was tainted by a $1.25 million payoff to a key witness for the U.S. government. Noriega was captured by U.S. military forces following the 1989 invastion of Panama. He was convicted in April 1992 of turning his country into a way station for the Medellin drug cartel.

E51,E512,ECAT,GCAT,GDIP	 The U.N.'s Iraq Sanctions Committee on Monday approved procedures to deliver humanitarian aid to Iraqis on a prioritised need basis, pushing acceptance of food and medicine supply contracts ahead of less vital commodities. The change was requested by Iraq in February, leading committee technical experts to meet on Friday where agreements were reached to alter existing practices. Today's committeee action approves those technical changes, but more work must be done to untangle financial questions before the prioritised process is implemented, according to the sanctions chairman, Portugal's Ambassador Antonio Monteiro. Iraq is allowed to import food and aid as part of a humanitarian exception to six-year-old sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990. For a six-month period Iraq is permitted to sell $2 billion worth of crude oil, receipts are then to be used for buying aid, reparation payments and other expenses. Even though the deal has been in place since December 10, and more than 100 million barrels of oil sold, food and medicine have yet to reach Iraqi civilians.   First shipments of food, however, did reach Iraq last week, but have yet to funnel through the distribution process. Monteiro said he hoped the new prioritised procedures would be finalised by U.N. departments this week. Until now, humanitarian goods have been processed on a first-come-first served basis, leading to an abundance of aid contract approvals for non-food items, like bath soap, tea and detergent. Iraq wants to distribute a variety of goods to ensure compatibility with its existing rationing system, filling a so-called &quot;food basket&quot; of items. Monteiro said the U.N.'s Department of Humanitarian Affairs was working on the prioritised food list, while the World Health Organisation was performing the same task for medicinal needs. &quot;We approved a list of priorities that will come out, I hope, this week,&quot; Monteiro said. Financial details must also be worked out to speed aid delivery, Monteiro said, noting the committee wants to utilize available money to approve more aid contracts. &quot;We would like to immediately use the money that comes from sales of oil after getting the letter of credit on these sales,&quot; Monteiro said.   Currently, oil sales receipts must be in a special escrow account before aid contracts can be paid for, and approved. Monteiro said 359 goods application contracts have been received by the U.N. Of that total, 82 have reached the sanctions committee, with 57 gaining approval. Of the remaining contracts before the panel, 12 have been processed and are awaiting approval under a no-objection procedure, and 13 were on-hold for various reasons. Monteiro said 40 oil contracts have been approved thus far, with approved contract volumes of 112 million barrels. No oil contracts were pending approval, according to Monteiro. On a related note, Monteiro said the Russian representative at the sanctions meeting reiterated statements from Moscow earlier on Monday, denying a deal to develop oil reserves in Iraq violated U.N. sanctions. &quot;The deal will only be applied after the regime's sanctions are removed,&quot; Monteiro said, paraphrasing the statement from the Russian delegate.

C15,C152,CCAT	 The UK traded options market was quiet on Tuesday as a lack of corporate or economic data kept most participants on the sidelines, dealers said. &quot;It has been a real nothing morning,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;Until we get some fresh news things will remain quiet.&quot; Dealers don't expect the options market to pick up until the end of the month when corporates start reporting earnings figures. A straddle buy in Redland Plc was the main feature in an otherwise subdued morning session. The straddle was set up when one dealer bought 500 January 360 calls at 10p and at the same time bought 500 January 360 puts at 15p. This strategy allows the buyer to make large potential profits if the underlying share moves far enough in either direction. The buyer has a predetermined maximum loss, equal to the amount of the initial investment of 25p, plus commissions. Redland shares were down 12-1/2p at 347p by 1235 GMT. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717

GCAT,GDIP	 North Korean U.N. envoy Kim Hyong U paid his first courtesy call on Friday on Secretary-General Kofi Annan. In reply to a question, he told Reuters they did not discuss the case of Hwang Jang-yop, a high-ranking North Korean official who has sought asylum in South Korea's embassy in Beijing. &quot;I am sure that this is not an issue to be discussed between myself and the secretary-general of the United Nations,&quot; Kim said, speaking through an interpreter. &quot;We are very sure that this kind of case of so-called political asylum on the part of the secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea's central committee...cannot be conceived of, nor can it happen. We are sure. &quot;This is nothing but (one of) the historical kidnapping cases pursued by the South Korean authorities,&quot; he added. Kim said he had called on the secretary-general, who took office on Jan. 1, to congratulate him on his appointment and wish him success. He also expressed gratitude for the recent launching by a U.N. agency of an appeal for assistance to North Korea &quot;with regard to the natural disasters.&quot; He was referring to a $41.5 million appeal by the World Food Programme to avert the danger of famine due to poor harvests and serious flooding. The North Korean envoy said he told Annan he was sure measures would be taken to ensure that the &quot;abnormal relationship existing between my country and the United Nations&quot; would be rectified. By this he said he meant what happened after &quot;the United States...started the Korean War in the name of the United Nations and under the flag of the United Nations.&quot; North Korea and the United Nations were then &quot;in a state of war,&quot; requiring the removal of obstacles dating from that period. But he stressed that his meeting with Annan was &quot;not because there is any serious case to discuss with him&quot; but to congratulate him.

Treasury bill yields were slightly higher but bond prices were slightly lower. Volume was moderate,&quot; a local dealer said. In treasury bills, three-months closed at a yield of 2.70/2.65 percent compared with Tuesday's yield of 2.68/2.63 percent and one-year at a yield of 2.63/2.58 percent against 2.58/2.53 percent.

M14,M143,MCAT	 U.S. gasoline markets were mixed midday  on Friday, with the Midcontinent holding firm on modest pipeline inventories  and New York Harbor holding back as players gauge NYMEX after the  August contract expiry. On the NYMEX, the new September gasoline futures contract was up 0.90  cents at 63.75 cents a gallon, with heat down 0.9 at 56.10 cents.  September crude oil was down two cents at $20.12 a barrel. MIDCONTINENT Midcontinent unleaded gasoline markets remained firm on following  aggressive buying on Thursday amid concern of low inventories. &quot;It's sort of a panic thing going on. There is only 18-days of supply  in the system and buyers came out trying to stay ahead of any more  prices moves,&quot; said a Group Three trader. Prompt barrels of unleaded gasoline in Group Three held at 6.50/7.00  cents over the screen. Barrels for delivery by August 10th were pegged  at 5.50/6.00 cents and any months at 2.75/3.00 cents. Chicago markets also held firm, with unleaded for prompt deliver50  cents. U.S. GULF Prompt conventional M1 gasoline differentials firmed modestly in early  Friday trade, with offers rising about 0.25 cent to sit at 1.00 cent  over the September futures contract. However, the strength appeared limited to nearby barrels, one market  player said, with any-month M1 seen offered between 2.75 and 2.85  cents under the September futures, nearly flat on the day. Distillate differentials showed no movement in early action, though  heating oil managed to hold the modest gains made earlier this week,  with offers holding near 2.35 cents under the September NYMEX. Activity appeared fairly brisk in the early part of the day, though  trade would likely quiet significantly by mid-afternoon as traders  took an early start to the weekend, one market watcher said. NEW YORK HARBOR New York Harbor gasoline differentials were slightly lower in quiet  trade as players tried to gauge market direction following the expiry  of the August NYMEX contract. &quot;It's hard to gauge the market with the month change. The basis points  are higher but the market is a bit weaker with the September contract,&quot;  said a Harbor gasoline trader. Very prompt barrels of &quot;M2&quot;-grade unleaded conventional gasoline were  pgged at 2.75/3.00 cents over September futures, with the any month  barrels notional. Prompt &quot;A2&quot; reformulated northern-grade was talked 7.25/7.50 cents  over the print, slightly weaker, but still strong, from Thursday.  Barrels for delivery by August 10th were about 5.00/5.25 cents over  the screen. The distillate markets were talked quiet and largely steady, also  in quiet activity ahead of the weekend. -- New York Energy Desk +1 212 859 1620
C18,C181,CCAT	 Great Western Financial Corp continued to discuss possible combinations with other banks in an attempt to thwart H.F. Ahmanson and Co's $6.1 billion hostile bid, sources familiar with the situation said. &quot;Active discussions are ongoing,&quot; said a source close to Great Western, citing Norwest Corp and Washington Mutual Savings Bank as participants in the talks. &quot;There is still activity going on to generate a more attractive alternative to Ahmanson's bid, but Great Western is having a tough time finding a bid to match that one,&quot; said another source familiar with the process. Both Norwest and Washington Mutual declined comment. American Banker last week reported Norwest chief executive officer Richard Kovacevich acknowledged he has on several occasions looked but not bid at an acquisition candidate. Kovacevich also said California is not a state that is critical area for Norwest to be in, the newspaper reported. Washington Mutual remains on the top of most analysts' lists as a possible rival suitor. One industry newsletter, SNL Bank MergerFAX, reported that Washington Mutual's chief executive officer Kerry Killinger indicated he would be willing to accept earnings per share dilution for a strategic merger. Company officials had no immediate comment on the report, which if true, would marke a change from past statements by Killinger, who has expressed an interest in acquisitions only if they are not dilutive to earnings. Pressure on Great Western intensified Monday as Ahmanson commenced a consent solicitation of Great Western shareholders to support its bid after a Delaware court ruled against Great Western's request for a restraining order. &quot;Pressure is mounting on Great Western and they'll have to announce a rival bid shortly to maintain control of the situation,&quot; said Lloyd Greif, president of investment banking firm Greif and Co.

C33,C331,CCAT,GCAT,GDEF	 Israel Aircraft Industries said Monday it signed new contracts worth $1.6 billion in 1996, up from $1.47 billion in 1995. Commercial contracts fell to $432 million from $453 million in 1995, while military deals rose slightly to $1.15 billion from $1.02 billion, state-owned IAI said. The order backlog includes a $638 million contract to upgrade 54 Phantom jets for the Turkish Air Force. The aerospace and defence company has 309 customers in 64 countries, against 292 clients in 60 countries in 1995. Despite the rise in new contracts, IAI is expected to suffer a loss of tens of millions of dollars for 1996, the Globes financial newspaper reported, without citing its sources. An IAI spokeswoman declined to comment on the Globes report. IAI has not published financial statements in recent years.

C15,C151,C1511,C152,CCAT	 Shares in supermarket group Somerfield Plc fell as the market called a halt to the stock's steady ascent ahead of results. &quot;The profits were less than expected on a proforma basis and people don't believe the story long-term,&quot; said one analyst. &quot;The question has been: can they do enough to revitalise a very compromised portfolio of stores, to stop the business going backwards? At the moment it looks as though they can but against market conditions which are not very competitive,&quot; he said. The stock fell 5-1/2p to 190p. Earlier, Somerfield said its first set of yearly results since flotation showed actual pre-tax profit of 105.4 million stg, with proforma pre-tax profit at 101.6 million compared with analysts' expectations of 101.9-105 million. -- Louise Ireland, London Newsroom +44 171 542 8712
C31,CCAT	 McDonald's Corp's U.S. same store sales dropped an estimated four to six percent in May, analysts said Monday, due in part to the fast-food chain's 55-cent promotion. &quot;Campaign 55, it's just not working,&quot; Natwest Securities analyst Damon Brundage said, adding he estimates McDonald's U.S. same store sales in May were off four to five percent. Another analyst, who asked not to be named, said he expects McDonald's to re-examine Campaign 55, under which it offers featured sandwiches for 55 cents.   That analyst said he estimated McDonald's U.S. same store sales -- measuring results from units open at least a year -- were off four to six percent in May. McDonald's does not publicly release U.S. same-store sales results. The company was not available for comment. McDonald's in the past has stood by Campaign 55, calling it a long-term promotion. McDonald's stock fell 1-5/8 to 48-5/8 per share in mid-afternoon composite trading.   Analysts blamed Campaign 55 for hurting U.S. same store sales, saying the promotion cut the average check paid by consumers and has not increased customer traffic enough to compensate. Making sales in the U.S. more difficult is the fact that, a year ago, McDonald's rolled out its Arch Deluxe hamburger, which attracted media and consumer attention. &quot;We're going against the Arch Deluxe rollout a year ago,&quot; added Everen Securities analyst Dean Haskell, who said he expects McDonald's U.S. same store sales to also be down in June. McDonald's launched Campaign 55 in April, starting with its breakfast sandwiches, which are priced at 55 cents when consumers also buy a drink and hash browns. Later in April, the promotion featured the Big Mac for 55 cents, when a drink and french fries are purchased. The featured sandwich is now the quarter-pounder hamburger with cheese for 55 cents.

C31,CCAT	 Sales of new cars in Bulgaria fell by around 30 percent this year while second-hand car sales remained steady as the market continued to shrink in this impoverished country, the car importers union said on Friday. &quot;I expect a more than 30 percent decline in new car sales this year,&quot; the head of the car importers union Boris Marekov told Reuters. Car sales by authorised Western car dealers for the first 11 months of this year amounted to around 7,000, down on 11,500 in 1995 and 13,107 in 1994. This compares to some 70,000 imported second-hand cars sold in 1996 and some 60,000 sold last year, said Marekov. Police say most of the imported second-hand cars are stolen and therefore are sold at much lower prices. High import taxes, a further four percent rise of value added tax to 22 percent this year and a drastic depreciation of the local currency have pushed new car prices higher, making them practically unsellable, car dealers said. &quot;Lack of incentives for importers of new cars leads to a hazardous ageing of Bulgaria's cars,&quot; said Marekov. The average age of some 90 percent of the cars driven in Bulgaria, mostly Soviet-made Ladas and Moskviches, is around 20 years and the age of the second-hand cars is between five and 15 years, statistics figures show. Prospects are less than bright as an unprecedented economic crisis caused by delayed market reforms has shrunk private businesses and reduced the buying ability of the average Bulgarian. A car-making joint venture between Rover Group Ltd, a subsidiary of German automotive group Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and a Bulgarian consortium, closed down in April complaining of lack of government support. -- Elisaveta Konstantinova, Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-84561

C12,C31,C311,CCAT,GCAT,GCRIM	 A U.S. textile makers' group Wednesday accused The Limited clothing store chain and two apparel importers of defrauding the government by falsely declaring that goods produced in China were the product of Hong Kong. A federal lawsuit filed by the American Textile Manufacturers Institute said The Limited had been misidentifying the origin of garments for years to allow it avoid paying hefty customs duties and penalties and to dodge country quotas. &quot;This is what we believe to be a widespread practice that has existed for a number of years,&quot; said Carlos Moore, the institute's executive vice president. &quot;What we're alleging here is that the government is being deprived of its rightful revenue.&quot; The Limited, based in Columbus, Ohio, said it has not had time to review the complaint but said it does not tolerate violations of the law or of its policies by its suppliers. &quot;The Limited is committed to full compliance with the spirit and letter of all legal requirements relating to the importation of goods into the United States,&quot; company General Counsel Samuel Fried said in a statement. An official for the chain -- which also owns Victoria's Secret, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Lane Bryant, Structure, Express and Lerner New York -- noted that neither the Customs Service nor the Justice Department joined the textile group in the litigation. Using the False Claims Act, which permits private citizens to file claims on behalf of the government, the textile makers' group filed its lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, where it claims many of the goods entered the country. The lawsuit, which also names apparel importers Tarrant Apparel Group of Los Angeles and Mast Industries Inc. of Andover Mass., as defendants, was filed in September but only unsealed by the court Tuesday after the government declined to exercise its option to join in the case. The complaint does not specify the value of the goods that allegedly were misidentified. But the textile group's counsel, Paul Cullen, put the revenue lost by the government because of the alleged violations in the millions of dollars. Under the act, the textile group said the government could recover three times duties and penalties totaling 410 percent of the value of the merchandise, plus a $5,000 to $10,000 penalty for each of tens of thousands of alleged false claims. The group said it could receive between 15 percent and 30 percent of the revenue recovered by the government. Besides helping the government recover money, the institute said it used the act in a customs case for the first time to deter violators of customs rules and to aid its members, who have less than half of the American textile market share. &quot;We do not want to compete against illegally entered merchandise,&quot; said Moore. &quot;All legal producers of goods are being hurt by any illegal entry of such goods into the United States.&quot; Moore said his group's investigation found shipments that were labeled as being from sections of Hong Kong that had no facilities for making apparel. &quot;It was a transit point for goods that were actually produced in China,&quot; he said. A retail industry attorney said the customs rules on determining the origin of garments, which could be produced in one country and cut and sewn in another, are based generally on where their last &quot;substantial transformation&quot; occurred. The attorney said the textile makers' group has an interest in trying to deter imports of garments from Asia because its members have made substantial investments in production facilities in Mexico and the Caribbean.
GCAT,GCRIM	 France plans a crackdown on the sexual abuse of children, Justice Minister Jacques Toubon said on Wednesday. A package of measures cracking down on sex tourism, pornographic material and messages on the Internet computer network involving children will be announced on November 20, he said after meeting associations for the protection of children. Humanitarian Action Minister Xavier Emmanuelli is to propose steps to increase prevention of child abuse, while Toubon will introduce a bill on punishment. The plan was announced in the wake of Stockholm's first World Congresss on Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, and of the child sex and murder scandal in neighbouring Belgium which has stirred strong feelings in France. A senior magistrate was being held and questioned by police in the Alpine town of Chambery on Wednesday on allegations of indecent behaviour with young girls. The unnamed 54-year-old magistrate, a former children's judge, was involved in a group helping schoolchildren with their homework.
GCAT,GPOL,GVIO	 The head of Sierra Leone's Kamajor traditional hunters says they have no intention of joining the West African country's coup leaders in a government of national unity and want to stay out of politics. Ibrahim Bangura, national head of the Kamajors, told Reuters in an interview in the eastern capital of Kenema on Sunday that in order to reduce tension, he was trying to keep his men away from the army. But witnesses have reported clashes in recent days in the east and a senior military official in Freetown on Monday said the army was mobilising to break a Kamajor blockade on the main highway leading to the diamond-mining centre of Koidu. &quot;We have no intention of joining the present military government in a government of national unity as they call it,&quot; he said at his compound, protected by scores of heavily armed Kamajors in their trademark charms and floppy hats. &quot;We are not politicians, we were formed by people at the community level to protect our villages and towns,&quot; he said. Military leader Johnny Paul Koroma told visiting traditional leaders in the capital Freetown on Friday that he would like the Kamajors to join a national unity government. On taking over, his administration banned all civil defence groups, a ban the Kamajors have ignored. The Kamajors, a colourful feature of village life across West Africa, far outnumber the army, which toppled elected president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah on May 25 and their allies in the rebel Revolutionary United Front. Estimates of their strength range from at least 20,000 up to 37,000. The army numbers 5,000, the rebels around 8,000, of whom at least half have flooded into Freetown since the coup. &quot;I am trying to keep my Kamajors away from the military as much as possible to prevent confrontations,&quot; Bangura said. Tejan Kabbah and his administration used the Kamajors with the army to push the rebels, who took up arms in 1991 and at one stage threatened to take Freetown, east towards Liberia. The coup leaders accuse him of humiliating the army, sowing tribal hatred and blocking a peace deal he signed with rebel leader Foday Sankoh last November. Kamajors are easily recognisable by their African charms, animal skins, floppy cotton bonnets, guns and brown or yellow rough textured clothing. Bangura wore a blue and white striped safari suit. Traditionally Kamajors carry old shotguns but now many in Sierra Leone, particularly since the Kabbah-inspired offensives, have AK-47s and rocket propelled grenade launchers. Most of these new weapons were captured from rebels or soldiers. In Kenema, as in the southern region capital Bo, there is underlying opposition to the coup. Military governor Captain Edward Kanneh, who took office at the weekend after arriving on Friday under heavy military guard, won applause at an initial meeting on Sunday but in private many of those who attended said they wanted democracy restored. &quot;We will continue to be disobedient and refuse to turn up for work even if we are all brought out onto the streets and shot dead,&quot; a medical worker said. &quot;The new military boys in power have overthrown our democratically elected president.&quot; Witnesses said 14 people were killed in heavy fighting between Kamajors and soldiers in the town of Joru near Kenema on Thursday. Survivors fled to Kenema. Military sources said army reinforcements had been sent to Ngieyema in the same area later after similar clashes there.
C31,CCAT,M14,M141,MCAT	 French coffee consumption is expected to fall in 1997, mostly the result of higher retail prices, the chairman of the French coffee industry and trade association said on Thursday. Consumption rose three percent last year and was broadly stable for the first three months of 1997 but consumers should start feeling the pinch of higher retail prices by the end of June, Jean-Claude Frankel told Reuters. &quot;By end of June consumers will feel the impact of price hikes passed in April. Some roasters are planning a third rise for early June, which should be felt in autumn. It is thus very likely that consumption will fall in 1997,&quot; he said.   Asked if roasters would eventually hold back price hikes in a bid to avoid a sharp fall in consumption, he said &quot;If (arabica futures) prices remain at 250 cents, that is possible, but at 280 cents or more there will be further increases.&quot; In New York July arabica futures soared 12.85 cents per pound to end at 253.10 cents on Wednesday after coffee-exporting countries agreed to extend an agreement to limit exports for another 12-months despite soaring world prices. -- Paris Newsroom +331 4221 5542
C21,CCAT	 Fifty years ago the American landscape was forever changed when Jackie Robinson became the first black major league baseball player, &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; made its stage debut, and grocery store shelves were filled with Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil. The thin aluminum sheet introduced by Reynolds Metals Co. in 1947 has unending versatility. Cooks use it to protect a meal from ruin while a handyman might shape it into an instant container. Reynolds Metals developed the product at the end of World War II when the defence industry's need for vast amounts of aluminum had dried up. The product was first used in Richmond, Va., the company's home base, and spread to other cities along the East Coast, said Charles Mapes, a retired executive and one of the first salesmen of Reynolds Wrap. The idea behind consumer use of aluminum foil, he said, dates to Thanksgiving 1945, when a Reynolds Metals employee could not find a baking pan his wife wanted for the turkey. &quot;He couldn't find a pan so he brought home this foil they had been playing around with in the (industrial packing) plant,&quot; Mapes said, noting its gauge was much heavier than today's thickness of less than a thousandth of an inch. &quot;It cooked the turkey so well that a new product idea was generated to put this out as a consumer product,&quot; he added. Two years later, the company had a hit product that it sold mainly at mom-and-pop corner grocery stores. Though its production was interrupted for more defence needs during the Korean War, Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil had become a nationwide product by 1957. It still outranks other brands in overall quality, according to Consumer Reports, an independent consumer testing and ratings organisation. Aluminum foil's success was the catalyst for other innovative food-wrapping products such as Reynolds plastic wrap, oven bags, and bake cups, said John Lowrie, general manager of Reynolds' Consumer Products unit. While Reynolds Metals was first to market with foil paper, the first food-wrapping product was Scott Paper's wax paper, developed in 1927, and sold under the Cut-Rite brand name. &quot;We were the second of all the products on the market with aluminum foil and immediately became the largest of the wrapping materials makers,&quot; Lowrie said. Reynolds Metals has garnered more than 50 percent of the market for aluminum foil, leading several independent foil makers. It acquired Cut-Rite wax paper a decade ago and now has half of that market too, but its 20 percent of the plastics wraps business trails Dow Chemicals Co. Together the products make up the packaging sector that contributed 44 percent of Reynolds Metals' $7 billion in sales last year. Net income for the year was $89 million, or 82 cents a share, after accounting and first-quarter restructuring charges. Aluminum foil's 50th anniversary has so far been marked with a bit of nostalgia -- the top of the shiny paper's signature blue and silver box has the 1947 logo: a curled ribbon marked &quot;Reynolds Wrap Pure Aluminum Foil for 1001 Kitchen Miracles&quot; against a pink background. The company also donated 50 vans to Meals on Wheels, a volunteer programme that prepares and delivers meals to homebound people. &quot;Our whole focus is on food, and to be involved with a food charitable cause really made a lot of sense,&quot; Lowrie said.&quot; It has had a five-year alliance with the group. Reynolds Metals pledged to donate up to $150,000 from the January sales of Reynolds' aluminum, plastic wrap, and oven bags to Meals on Wheels; and was seeking 50,000 new volunteers for the project by putting inside cartons of aluminum foil the toll-free telephone number consumers can call to volunteer.

M11,MCAT	 The Bratislava Stock Exchange's SAX index eased slightly in thin trading on Friday, falling 1.08 points to 203.79 on losses to shares of oil refiner Slovnaft. Slovnaft dipped five crowns to 990, on 43 shares, but brokers said they did not see this as the beginning of a downtrend due to thin volumes. &quot;I am sure it (Slovnaft) can break through the 1,000 crown- level again soon, once liquidity becomes slightly better,&quot; Libor Briska of Creditanstalt said. But, he added that there seemed to be little chance that market on the whole would improve in the near future. &quot;This is a sleepy period indeed, I think the index will fluctuate by plus/minus one percent next week,&quot; he said. Steel maker VSZ was one of few blue chips to post gains, closing five crowns higher at 750. Overall volume fell to 59,918 shares, from 181,416 shares traded on Thursday, while turnover eased to 42.8 million crowns, from 70.52 million.
C18,C182,C24,CCAT	 Venture Stores Inc., seeking a new source of capital, said Thursday it agreed to sell 20 underperforming stores in four states to rival Kmart Corp. The struggling retailer did not disclose how much it would receive from the sale, but said it planned to take a charge of about $63 million, or $3.50 a share, in the second quarter related to the sale and to liquidate inventory. O'Fallon, Mo.-based Venture, which has not posted a quarterly profit since early 1996, said it has not ruled out further store sales. It hired Kimco Realty Corp. to help find ways to raise more money through real estate financings. &quot;Selling these 20 stores will provide additional capital to continue our multiyear repositioning programme with a stronger focus on our traditional Midwestern core markets,&quot; company Chairman Robert Wildrick said in a statement. The sale involved five stores in Dallas, 10 in Houston, two in Indianapolis, and one each in Des Moines, Iowa; Waterloo, Iowa; and Tulsa, Okla. For Kmart, the deal was a low-cost way to expand in key markets, including Dallas, where it already had 14 stores, and Houston, where it had 18, analysts said. &quot;I guess it's just an opportunistic real estate transaction,&quot; said Richard Church of Smith Barney. &quot;A lot of the rationalisation in Kmart's international markets has opened up the opportunity to expand more aggressively domestically.&quot; Venture has been adrift in a roiling sea of competition from Kmart and other top discount retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Dayton Hudson Corp.'s Target for several years. Seeking to distinguish itself from the pack, Venture revamped its stores two years ago to stock more profitable home-furnishing goods and get rid of less-profitable hardware and electronics merchandise. The strategy, however, has not paid off. Venture's same-store sales, or sales of stores open a year, have fallen for 25 consecutive months. Meanwhile, its losses have mounted. Kmart planned to convert the 20 Venture outlets to Big Kmart stores, a new format designed to make it easier for customers to locate merchandise, said spokesman Robert Burton. The company has not ruled out buying more stores from Venture. &quot;If we have an opportunity to acquire other stores that make sense from a strategic point of view ... we would consider it,&quot; Burton said. Venture said it hired the investment banking firm Houlihan, Lokey, Howard &amp; Zukin to seek out new capital. In March, the company arranged a $250 million secured credit facility with BT Commercial Corp. Because the sale of the stores was to result in a charge, the company was negotiating amendments to the facility, which Venture expected to be granted. Experts said Venture, in addition to selling more stores, probably would unload other assets or consider selling a  piece of itself to provide liquidity for the fall and holiday seasons. &quot;This might be the start of a real estate rationalisation (program),&quot; said Margaret Cannella, managing director at Citicorp Securities. &quot;It's a small step.&quot; Venture's stock finished off 12.5 cents at $2.625 on the New York Stock Exchange. Kmart fell 6 cents to end at $11.94, also on the NYSE. ( )
C17,C171,C18,C181,CCAT	 Otter Tail Power Co said Monday its board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan. The plan &quot;provides protection against hostile takeovers and market activities that could result in a sale of the company,&quot; Otter Tail said in a news release. But the move is not in response to any specific takeover bid for the company, controller Jeff Legge said in an interview.   &quot;This is just a preventative measure in response to what we see around us in the utility business,&quot; Legge said. Under the plan, the company declared a dividend of one right for each common share oustanding on February 7, 1997. The rights, which allow a holder to buy certain amounts of a newly created preferred stock, become exercisable in the event a person or group acquires or makes a tender offer for 15 percent or more of the company's common shares, the company said. Otter Tail's board reserves the right to approve a sale of the company or redeem the rights under certain circumstances, the company said. Earlier Monday, Otter Tail reported fourth quarter net income of $7.7 million, or $0.64 a share, compared to $7.8 million, or $0.64 a share a year ago. ((Chicago newsdesk 312 408 8787))

E12,E41,E411,ECAT,GCAT,GPOL	 President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on Thursday met Prime Minister Romano Prodi to discuss ways to tackle Italy's mounting unemployment problem quickly. Prodi said in a statement that he had described to Scalfaro measures already taken to ease joblessness and had given a preview of &quot;urgent initiatives the government plans to take in the next days to help create jobs, especially in the south&quot;. Political sources quoted by Italian news agencies said the government indicated it was considering a decree law to promote investments, especially in the poorer south, to create new jobs. Earlier on Thursday, a senior member in Prodi's coalition had said the prime minister, who put employment at the top of his agenda when he took office 10 months ago, had been slow to get to grips with Italy's jobless problem. &quot;We must be honest,&quot; Cesare Salvi, leader of the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) in the Senate (upper house), said in a radio interview. &quot;On the jobs problems, the government is late.&quot; The PDS is the biggest party in the centre-left government. Prodi said two weeks ago employment rose 0.4 percent in 1996 and he expected a clear improvement in 1997, but the most recent data showed unemployment at 12.2 percent in October with the jobless problem especially acute in the underdeveloped south. Union leaders are planning a mass rally for jobs later this month and Pietro Larizza, whose UIL trade union confederation is one of Italy's big three labour groups, warned on Thursday they would call a general strike if more was not done. Scalfaro had announced on Wednesday that he had convened the unusual gathering of ministers to thrash out what he called the &quot;terrible&quot; situation. Labour Minister Tiziano Treu, Interior Minister Giorgio Napolitano, Transport Minister Claudio Burlando, Treasury and Budget Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, and Industry Minister Pierluigi Bersani also attended. Prodi's government signed a pact for jobs with unions and employers last September, including a reduction in the working week, incentives for people starting their own businesses and tax breaks on research, to try to boost the employment market. He said at the time the pact would have an immediate impact on jobs. Since then, however, his room for manoeuvre has been greatly narrowed by a huge austerity budget and he plans to unveil another mini-budget in the coming weeks in a bid to join a European single currency at its planned 1999 launch. Salvi, speaking to private station Italia Radio, noted that a draft bill on the jobs pact was not presented in the Senate until January and full details still had to be worked out.
GCAT,GDEF,GDIP	 Iran's navy has the potential to become an increasingly effective force in the oil-rich Gulf, a British navy commander said in Dubai on Tuesday. &quot;I have no doubt they are getting better at using the equipment they have got...They have got some systems that could be very effective,&quot; Rear Admiral Alan West, commander of the UK Task Group told reporters aboard aircraft carrier Invincible. The Islamic Republic's submarine and surface-to-surface missile capabilities were highlighted by West as being concerns. &quot;Obviously one has to keep an eye on countries where you are not sure exactly how they are going to utilise their forces to see how capable and competent they become,&quot; West added. Tehran in September said it would receive a third Russian-made Kilo-class submarine in six months, building on its position as the only Gulf state to have submarines. Iran regularly carries out naval exercises in the important oil waterway. &quot;She (Iran) has got some new conventional submarines which obviously one would watch with some interest. She has got surface-to-surface missiles and she has other defence equipment,&quot; West said. A senior U.S. naval officer said in March that Iran had boosted its naval firepower by fitting Chinese-built anti-ship cruise missiles on some of its warships. Iran has repeatedly said that its weapons are only for defence purposes and says Washington falsely accuses it of threatening regional security in order to scare its Gulf Arab allies into buying more U.S. weapons. The Invincible arrived in Dubai, one of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates, on Tuesday as part of a seven ship-strong British naval task force to practice carrier-style operations in the Gulf over the next three weeks. Joint exercises will be carried out with U.S. naval forces in the region and possible cooperation with Gulf states is also being sought, West said. The carrier hosts seven Sea King anti-submarine warfare helicopters in addition to Sea Harrier aircraft and three Sea King early warning helicopters.

C18,C183,CCAT,E12,ECAT	 Ukraine's State Property Fund, the state privatisation agency, plans to start selling shares in enterprises abroad next year, beginning with Russia, the fund's chairman said on Thursday. &quot;Right now we are in discussions and are reviewing our laws on selling shares of Ukrainian companies under privatisation on other countries' markets,&quot; Yuri Yekhanurov told a news conference. He said Ukraine would probably sell shares in Russia first, and would use investment banks or investment funds to prepare share issues, he said. Yekhanurov stressed that the fund would seek the support of government economic authorities and parliamentary committees. Ukraine, which has yet to privatise about 3,000 medium- and large-scale enterprises, has been criticised by foreign funding bodies for the slowness of its privatisation process. Parliament views some 5,000 enterprises as strategic to state security and has removed them from privatisation. --Natalya Zinets, Kiev Newsroom +380 44 229 2264
M13,M131,MCAT	 Hungary's overnight rates continued to climb slowly on Wednesday, suprising many dealers following Monday's repo rate cuts. Overnight money closed around 22.25, slightly up from Tuesday's 22.125 close. &quot;Expectations of repo cuts had been strong (before the cuts),&quot; said Sandor Szatmari of Unicbank. &quot;I believe considerable amounts may have went (before the cuts into reverse repo deals) to the National Bank of Hungary (NBH).&quot; On Monday, the central bank cut all four repo rates by 0.5 percent, with the one-week reverse repo falling to 21 percent.   &quot;I think many banks placed substantial amounts in one-week reverse repo deals (before the repo cuts),&quot; said Levente Fulop of Magyar Fejlesztesi Bank, adding that this must have tightened the forint liquidity of some banks. Traders said banks needed money to replenish their reserves and for tax-payments on February 20. But money supply on the market has not weakened substantially, and the overnight rates may reverse the current rising trend this week or early next week, traders said. -- Sandor Peto, Budapest newsroom (36 1) 327 4040

C15,C152,CCAT	 E.W. Blanch Holdings Inc. said Monday it would take a fourth-quarter charge of $22.8 million to reflect the restructuring of its operations in San Antonio, Tex. The risk management and distribution services company said the charge included a $19.5 million writedown of goodwill, an intangible asset such as a brand name, associated with the 1994 acquisition of the Elton George Cos. The charge, which also includes a $3.25 million reserve for restructuring, will reduce fourth-quarter earnings by $1.05 a share, the company said. Analysts expect Minneapolis-based E.W. Blanch to earn 37 cents a share in the fourth quarter, according to First Call, which tracks estimates. The company reported earnings of $2.8 million, or 21 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter on revenues of $20.5 million. E. W. Blanch stock fell 12.5 cents to $19.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.

GCAT,GCRIM,GDIP	 Mexico did not make any concessions to the United States in order to win certification of Mexico's efforts in the war on drugs, foreign minister Angel Gurria said on Tuesday. Responding to media reports that Mexico agreed to several U.S. conditions to beef up its anti-drugs fight, Gurria told Mexican congressmen that there was no such deal. &quot;Let me be very clear: there were no conditions accepted by Mexico or concessions promised by Mexico to obtain the certification by President Clinton,&quot; Gurria said. Time magazine reported during the weekend that Mexico intends to scrap its current anti-drugs agency and replace it with another modelled after the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Some local newspaper reports also suggested Mexico agreed to allow the U.S. Coast Guard to board Mexican ships in Mexico's territorial waters to check for drugs and allow U.S. DEA agents to make arrests in Mexico. Gurria acknowledged Mexico's anti-drugs agency was being overhauled, but said that was a process announced before certification.

M14,M143,MCAT	 North Sea crude differentials were steady to slightly up in a quiet market early on Tuesday, supported by recent demand from Asian and U.S. buyers, traders said. At least two deals were reported on the Brent paper market, with two June/July spreads trading at -11 cents and -13 cents respectively. No physical deals were reported early on Tuesday but a cargo of Norwegian Troll exchanged hands on Friday at Dated evens. On the cash market, the June Brent contract was a little weaker, three cents down at $18.24 a barrel by 1104 GMT. Sellers of Norwegian crude, saying they were confident because they were holding lesser unsold cargoes than a month earlier, have raised their asking price. One said he was now asking five cents a barrel more for Statfjord at Dated Brent +25 cents. &quot;People are asking higher numbers but there are no buyers coming to the table at those kinds of numbers. I think everybody is very, very relaxed, they are still waiting to see what happens,&quot; one European trader said. Oseberg was steady at Dated Brent +15 while U.K. Forties was also steady at Dated +20/+25 cents. &quot;There's been strength in the market in the last few days in differentials, that's for sure,&quot; the Norwegian seller said. &quot;The spot cargoes are much less than last month. We have 20 May cargoes, mainly last decade, left and last month we had 36 cargoes. That's a very good indication,&quot; the seller said. &quot;There's been cargoes going to both Asia and the U.S. and that's been drying up the European market. &quot;When we saw a slow period a couple of weeks ago when the differentials were under stress, I guess the refiners were using up the stocks they built when they saw the contango, but it seems to be picking up now,&quot; the seller added.   Only one Brent cargo loading May 14-16 was turning wet on Tuesday. Prompt Brent intermonth spreads weakened while more distant months gained a little. May/June was five cents weaker on the bid side, talked at -25/-18 cents while June/July was three cents off at -15/-10 cents. July/August was 1-2 cents stronger, talked -10/-7 cents. The picture was the same for Brent CFDs or contracts for difference, with the prompt week slipping while distant weeks tightened slightly. This week was offered three cents weaker at June Brent -34 cents while May 12-16 was four cents tighter talked June Brent -30/-26 cents while the week after was some six cents stronger, June Brent -27/-25 cents. Mediterranean and West African markets remained firm though little action was seen. Urals was offered around dated Brent -90 cents with bids coming in under dated -$1 a barrel, traders said. The Far East continued to show good interest in West African grades though no deals were reported completed. Levels here were steady though some felt they had reached their short-term peak. &quot;I don't think we'll see them coming off sharply but at the same time the margins don't really warrant another big jump upwards,&quot; one major equity holder said. -H.

C11,C23,CCAT	 European plane consortium Airbus Industrie reaffirmed on Tuesday its hopes to build the A3XX aircraft, a plane seating over 500 passengers, to break Boeing's monopoly on this lucrative segment. Airbus senior executive Volker Von Tein told reporters at the Farnborough air show, &quot;One market segment exists which we simply cannot leave to our competitors forever. This is the large capacity airliner, the 500-seater plus, the most lucrative of all markets.&quot; The four-nation grouping estimates the market demand for this segment at 1,380 units worth $280 billion to the year 2014, figures disputed by Boeing Co which sees potential for only 470 planes of this type. Airbus senior vice president commercial John Leahy that the group aimed to deliver the first A3XX in 2003 and that development costs could be $8 billion -- or less in view of restructuring efforts. Von Tein said the project would require outside equity partners and the group's plans to convert to a joint stock company from the current partnership would be helpful. Airbus was looking for new partners in the United States and Asia, he said without naming names. Airbus envisages building three models seating between 555 and 690 on two decks. The plane would have a range of 7,500-8,000 nautical miles and offer low operating costs. Boeing on Monday presented its plans for stretched versions of its 747 jumbo jet, with a 747-500X seating 460 and a 747-600X seating 550.

M11,MCAT	 Stock watchers say the current rally in Mexican share prices is an overdue reaction to a cheap market and a stronger economy triggered by new year portfolio juggling and should continue for a while. Nonetheless, they do feel that, while 1997 will be a positive year for Mexico, political factors mean that most gains will be sooner rather than later in the year, with mid-term elections looming in July. In Mexico, the blue chip IPC index hit a record 3,631.36 points at the close on Tuesday, to add to five straight record closes last week.   Carlos Ponce, research head of Santander Investment in Mexico, said there were no new developments behind the New Year rally and strong fundamentals had existed for months. Mexican stocks had upside potential, Ponce said, due to a stable peso, falling real interest rates, an improved macroeconomic outlook and cheap multiples. Santander said Mexican stocks were trading at about eight times Firm Value/Earnings Before Income Tax, Depreciation and Amortization. Multiples below 10 times are considered cheap. Ponce saw most gains in share prices during the first quarter, with political factors weighing from April onwards.   Santander was positive for the first quarter of 1997 and overweight for the year. Their year-end 1997 target for the IPC was 4,600 points &quot;implying a 23 percent return in dollar terms,&quot; a recent report said. Mexico will on July 6 hold mid-term elections for the congress, several state governors and the first-ever election of a mayor for Mexico City. Luke Smith, an analyst at Mexico City's Interacciones brokerage said the New Year rally was due to seasonal factors.   &quot;There is no real new news. Funds tend to be aggressive in the New Year,&quot; he said. &quot;They dump their dogs for tax purposes,&quot; adding that, with the liquidity they hunt out strong performing blue chips. Ramon Ruiz, sales trader at the Latin American equities desk of Bankers Trust in New York, was upbeat about the outlook for Mexican stocks for the first half of 1997. Ruiz expected most government spending to be disbursed in the first half of 1997, as this is an election year, thus fueling a recovery in retail and construction stocks.   There were several &quot;tripwires&quot; for Mexico, however, which Ruiz listed as mid-term elections, latent guerrilla activity, corruption linked with drug-trafficking and a failure to end probes into top-level political assassinations in 1994. Santander agreed construction stocks would benefit from government spending, but said &quot;no retailer is expecting a strong recovery of consumer demand.&quot; Smith favoured construction and manufacturing stocks and some retail firms. There was less consensus over the financial sector, however.   Santander recommended being overweight, saying this was &quot;the area with the greatest upside potential in Mexico,&quot; after having lagged behind the market in general. But other analysts said there were still too many holes in accounting procedures to get a strong sense of the health of banks. With the New Year, foreign investors have turned their gaze back to Latin America, shaking off the December lure that booming U.S. markets offered. But Mexico may not be top choice, analysts said. Many preferred Brazil for 1997. &quot;The law of gravity got lost on its way down to Brazil,&quot; said Interacciones' Smith. &quot;Brazil will continue to be a main player. It's so hard to forget December 1994 in Mexico.&quot; Analysts noted that in spite of record closes, in dollar terms the IPC was still well below December 1994 levels, when a shock devaluation plunged the Mexican economy into its worst recession in five decades. The Brazilian Bovespa index, on the other hand, was substantially ahead in both dollar and local-currency terms. ((-- Mexico City newsroom +525 728-7907))
E12,ECAT,M13,M132,MCAT	 The Swiss franc slipped against the mark in Europe after a top Swiss National Bank official said the strong currency was ripe for correction and the bank could contribute to that process by adjusting monetary policy. A fairly hefty SNB injection of funds into the four-month area and the short end of the money market had also depressed the franc, as had a big sale of Swiss for yen, traders said. &quot;The franc has been hit by the comments from (SNB chief economist Georg) Rich about the SNB being prepared to trigger a market correction of the Swiss franc via monetary policy,&quot; said Michael Burke, senior economist at Citibank in London. &quot;That, combined with his comments suggesting the SNB has wide target bands for the currency, have pushed the franc lower,&quot; he added. The Swiss franc was quoted at 81.06/09 centimes per mark by 1008 GMT, down from an opening level of 80.83/85. It ended Thursday's European trade around 80.85/87. The SNB's Rich told Reuters he found it difficult to believe the highly-valued franc would continue to rise without limits. &quot;I think a situation will arise where markets would say the Swiss franc is so strongly overvalued that the possibility of a correction must be considered,&quot; Rich said in an interview. &quot;The Swiss National Bank could contribute to trigger such developments by adjusting monetary policy,&quot; he said. Rich said the SNB dreaded a watering down of the criteria for European monetary union, saying that could send the Swiss franc sharply higher. Preferable to that may be pegging the franc to the Euro, but an exchange rate band accomplished little. &quot;If it is wide it is not so far away from what we are doing at the moment,&quot; he said. Burke said the suggestion the SNB has wide currency target bands probably means it has an absolute pain threshold for Swiss franc strength at the 80.00 centimes per mark level. The Swiss central bank has made little secret of its dissatisfaction with the high value of its currency, recently pumping liquidity into money markets -- to little avail. Analysts said it appeared to be fighting a losing battle against a market now attracted to Swiss francs in the belief the Euro common currency would be less stable than the mark. Traders said speculative longs in Swiss franc/yen had sold around two billion francs for yen out of Zurich this morning, and that had fed through into mark/Swiss. Technical analysts said the mark's break of trendline resistance at 80.85/90 had set up a target of 81.10. -- London Newsroom +44-171-542-8969
C21,C24,CCAT,M14,M141,MCAT	 The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE), said on Tuesday it was maintaining its forecast for the Australian wheat crop at 21.3 million tonnes for 1996/97 to June 30. The forecast by the government's official commodities forecaster is below the 21.8 million tonnes expected by private forecaster Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd and the 21.5 million forecast by the Australian Wheat Board (AWB). Good rains and mild conditions through the late winter and early spring meant that yields would be above average across most of Australia, ABARE said in its December outlook.   However, there have been isolated crop problems, it said. Rain and strong winds disrupted harvests in central and western Queensland, resulting in downgrading and the loss of some crops, ABARE said. Also, frosts in Queensland and the Mallee regions of Victoria and South Australia in September caused severe but isolated reductions in yield in some areas. Upward revisions of both northern and southern hemisphere harvests, which have pushed world wheat prices lower, combined with a big Australian crop, meant that the likelihood that the Australian crop would need to be sold on lower priced markets over a longer period had increased, ABARE said.   Also, with some buyers possibly holding back on some forward purchases while prices were declining, opportunities for forward sales of Australian wheat will have been constrained, it said. As a result, the current forecast average pool return of Australian Standard White (ASW) wheat in 1996/97 of around A$185.00 a tonne may need to be revised as marketing of the new crop proceeds, ABARE said. ABARE sees Australian wheat exports at 13.340 million tonnes in 1996/97 versus 12.057 in 1995/96.   The figure only partially takes into account a planned one million tonne sale of Australian wheat to India for Jan/Feb delivery announced last week, an ABARE analyst said. &quot;It will lift the forecast, but not by a million tonnes,&quot; the analyst told Reuters. On a global scale, wheat production is forecast to rise in most major wheat exporting countries in 1996/97, ABARE said. With exportable surpluses rising and imports forecast to fall to the lowest in a decade to around 90 million tonnes, price will be well down on last year, it said.   The world indiator price of wheat (July/June) is forecast to average in the range of US$163.00-to US$205.00 a tonne, with a most likley outcome of around US$180.00 a tonne, some 14 percent below the 1995/96 average, ABARE said. World wheat production is forecast to rise by 7.8 percent to 579 million tonnes in 1996/97, the second highest on record, ABARE said. Record or near-record yields are expected to occur in Australia, the European Union and Argentina, it said.   The Argentine wheat crop is estimated to be 14.5 million tonnes in 1996/97, 58 percent higher than in 1995/96, ABARE said. &quot;As Argentina does not have the infrastructure to to store such a large crop, Argentine traders are attempting to ship wheat as soon after harvest as possible,&quot; ABARE said. To achieve this, Argentine wheat has been sold at discounted prices, it said. &quot;Even though Argentina is the smallest of the major exporters, the heavy discounting has contributed to rapidly falling world prices,&quot; ABARE said.   Improved seasons have also been experienced in importing countries, particularly China, Russia, Morocco, South Africa and Turkey, ABARE said. Chinese imports in 1996/97 are forecast to be five million tonnes lower than in 1995/96, it said. The lower imports in some countries are expected to be partially offset by increased imports by eastern European countries, such as South Korea and Algeria, ABARE said.
GCAT,GSPO	 Ken Griffey belted his league-leading eighth home run through snow and sleet and Alex Rodriguez drove in three runs to lead the Seattle Mariners to an 8-6 victory over the Detroit Tigers on Thursday. Griffey's two-run homer highlighted a four-run fifth inning and tied the club record he set last year for home runs in the month of April. Dan Wilson went 4-for-5 with an RBI single for the Mariners, who posted their eighth win in nine games despite the miserable winterlike conditions. &quot;It was hockey weather,&quot; Wilson said. &quot;It was just tough to do anything today. My fingers were freezing. We're just happy to get through this and get a W (win). It's just brutal playing in weather like this.&quot; Jeff Fassero (3-0) struggled with the difficult conditions but picked up his third win, giving up three runs and seven hits over five innings. &quot;It was miserable, especially with the freezing sleet,&quot; Fassero said. &quot;The worst thing is you can't get a feel for the ball. It's so slick, its hard to get a feel for any of your pitches.&quot; Tony Clark homered and drove in three runs for the Tigers. At Minnesota, Denny Hocking's two-out RBI single in the bottom of the 10th inning lifted the Twins to a 4-3 victory over the Anaheim Angels. Pinch runner Chris Latham scooted to third on a two-out double by Todd Walker, setting the table for Hocking, who lined a 1-2 pitch over shortstop Gary DiSarcina's head into left field to bring home the winning run. Hocking, batting in the ninth spot for the Twins, had three hits, including a two-run double in the sixth. Greg Swindell (1-0) allowed two hits in 4 1/3 innings of scoreless relief for the win. In Toronto, Otis Nixon drove in the winning run for the second straight game -- a single in the seventh inning -- and Paul Quantrill tossed three scoreless innings of relief as the Blue Jays edged the Oakland Athletics 5-4. Buddy Groom (0-1) started the seventh for Oakland and retired the first two batters. But he walked Shawn Green and gave up a single to Alex Gonzalez before Nixon slapped a RBI single to right to put the Jays up 5-4. Nixon and Orlando Merced each had three hits and drove in two runs for Toronto. Merced's game-tying triple in the sixth gave him 400 career RBI. Nixon also stole two bases. In Milwaukee, John Jaha drew a one-out walk with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth to lift the Brewers to a 5-4 victory over the struggling New York Yankees, who suffered their fifth loss in a row. David Weathers came in to face Jaha and threw four straight balls, forcing Fernando Vina across the plate with the winning run. Former Yankee Bob Wickman (2-0), the fourth Milwaukee pitcher, struck out Cecil Fielder with two runners on in the ninth to earn the win after the Brewers had rallied from a 4-1 deficit with two runs in the seventh and one in the eighth. In Boston, Jim Thome hit a two-run homer and Omar Vizquel's RBI single snapped a seventh-inning tie as the Cleveland Indians stopped a four-game slide with a 4-3 victory over the Red Sox. Steve Kline (3-0) allowed one run and two hits with two strikeouts in one inning for the win. Jose Mesa picked up a save. He allowed one hit and walked one but struck out Reggie Jefferson to end the game with runners stranded on second and third. Pat Borders also homered for Cleveland in the third to briefly put the Indians ahead 3-2. In Chicago, Mike Mussina pitched eight innings of three-hit ball and Cal Ripken drove in the only run of the game as the Baltimore Orioles nipped the White Sox 1-0. Mussina (2-1) yielded just two singles and a double. He struck out six and walked none for the win. Randy Myers notched his seventh save, retiring Frank Thomas for the final out with the tying run on base. Danny Darwin (0-1) gave up nine hits in nine innings in losing, despite retiring 10 of the last 11 batters he faced. With two out in the third, Roberto Alomar walked, Rafael Palmeiro singled to right and Ripken lined the next pitch into right to score Alomar. In Kansas City, Darren Oliver allowed five hits over eight innings and Lee Stevens and Dean Palmer drove in two runs each as the Texas Rangers beat the Royals 5-1. Oliver (1-1) allowed a first-inning run but just two hits thereaftera as the Rangers won their fourth in a row. Rangers outfielder Marc Sagmoen had an inside-the-park home run for his first major-league hit, becoming just the fourth player in 24 years to do so.

GCAT,GSPO	 German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said on Friday he had warned British Prime Minister John Major that he planned to be &quot;everywhere&quot; promoting Germany's bid to host the 2006 World Cup soccer finals. Kohl said in an interview with his hometown newspaper, the Rheinpfalz in Ludwigshafen, that he was tremendously interested in Germany winning the rights to host the 2006 finals, which England also want to stage. &quot;I told John Major that I would work everywhere for Germany's bid to host the World Cup,&quot; Kohl told the newspaper. Kohl said hosting the World Cup would be important for Germany because it would help build trust of Germany and hopefully generate positive sentiments towards Germany. Kohl said the World Cup could also help eradicate old prejudices against Germany and even help create new jobs. &quot;Sport is for me the most important business card for our country,&quot; Kohl said. Earlier, German soccer officials said it was fair that England should be allowed to compete to host the 2006 finals after UEFA retracted its outright support for the German bid and said it would also consider England's. But the German Soccer Association (DFB) said it was confident it would still win the backing of European soccer's governing body in the end. &quot;I think it is completely fair from UEFA's point of view that England's arguments are heard,&quot; said DFB spokesman Wolfgang Niersbach. &quot;But the DFB is unchanged in its view that UEFA will support our bid.&quot; Niersbach said Germany was not upset about UEFA's change of heart, triggered after England vehemently protested following UEFA's revelation last week that it had supported the German bid since 1993. &quot;We're staying calm and collected,&quot; said Niersbach. UEFA agreed on Friday that both England and Germany will make presentations of their bids in April. UEFA will select one country's bid and support it when it is submitted to FIFA in December 1998. FIFA will announce where the 2006 tournament will be held in June 2000.

M11,MCAT	 Philippine shares, hit by a wave of selling after the Dow tumbled again, fell to their lowest level in 15 weeks on Thursday with analysts seeing no sign of a quick end to the downswing. Even some favourite second liners succumbed to the selling pressure in a day of moderately heavy trading which saw the main index lose 57.44 points, or 1.82 percent, to close at 3,104.77 points. &quot;There was really a bloodbath at the exchange today. Everything is down and hardly anything is green and the one thing that's affecting the market is the Dow,&quot; said Irving Ackerman, president at I. Ackerman &amp; Co Inc. Thursday's closing index was the lowest since December 17 when the market's chief barometer skidded to 3,093.21 points. It had been rising almost steadily since, hitting a peak of 3,447.60 points last February 3. One of the few bulls in Thursday's herd of bears was Equitable Banking Corp, which closed at 117 pesos on the day of its debut, a premium over its 113.30 peso offer price. Its grey market price, however, had ranged from 120 to 125 pesos. Equitable was the most actively traded issue with turnover of 1.04 billion pesos. Many analysts traced the market's fall to persistent fears of hikes in U.S. interest rates and to Wall Street's own woes as the Dow reeled again on Wednesday, losing 94.04 to end at 6,517.01. &quot;It's generally negative sentiment,&quot; said senior investment analyst Bernadette Tamayo of the BPI Securities Corp, citing the drop of the Dow and anxieties about U.S. interest rates as among the factors pushing stock down. &quot;Investors just want to get out for a while until it cools down,&quot; Tamayo said. But she said the market should consolidate shortly. &quot;About the only thing positive is that liquidity is back, Equitable is listed, the chart hasn't pierced the support (of 3,100),&quot; she said. &quot;Those are the good things going for the market.&quot; Among the day's big losers were Matushita Electric which closed at 12.50 pesos from 14.50 pesos, and Rizal Commercial Banking Corp-A, which dropped to 69.00 pesos from 80.00 pesos. Empire East Land Inc the housing development subsidiary of Megaworld Properies and Holdings Inc, and Lepanto Consolidated-B were also bloodied. Empire East closed at 7.40 pesos from 8.50 while Lepanto fell to 1.08 pesos from 1.20 pesos. &quot;Certain issues that are fundamentally sound, like Belle, fell because of the negative sentiment,&quot; analyst Alexis Cabel of Angping &amp; Associates Securitis Inc said. Belle Corp dropped to 7.70 pesos from 8.10 pesos. &quot;Investors have profited from these companies, like Belle, and now that there is selling pressure, they're liquidating their holdings.&quot; &quot;I think in the next trading days there will still be some selling pressure because there's no particular reason for stocks to go up. First quarter results will be out late this month to early next month so there's no development yet.&quot; -- RUBEN ALABASTRO (632) 841 8913 Fax 817 6267

C18,C181,CCAT	 Giddings &amp; Lewis Inc Monday stuck by its insistance that hostile suitor Harnischfeger Industries Inc agree not to pursue an unsolicited bid for two years before it reveals to Harnischfeger confidential financial informaiton. In a letter to Jeffery Grade, chief executive of Harnischfeger, a St. Francis, Wisconsin-based mining, paper making and material handling equipment maker, Giddings chairman Marvin Isles said the company's offer to let Harnischfeger look at its books after signing a confidentiality and &quot;standstill&quot; agreement remains open.   On Friday, Grade said Harnischfeger was willing to sign a confidentiality agreement, but not a standstill agreement, which would prohibit Harnischfeger from pursuing a bid for the machine tool and industrial products maker without Giddings' permission. On April 25, Harnischfeger announced a $19 a share cash tender offer for Giddings and Lewis, a deal valued at about $747 million, including the assumption of Giddings' debt. Last week, Giddings' board of directors rejected the offer as inadequate. Harnischfeger is proceeding with a tender offer to shareholders. A Harnischfeger spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. Harnischfeger shares rose 3/4 to 43 Monday and Giddings shares rose 1/8 at 20-3/4. ((Chicago newsdesk, 312-408-8787))
M11,MCAT	 London's FTSE 100 share index was expected to open around 40 points weaker on Tuesday in the wake of the second-largest points fall in the Dow's history, with the British market's recent slide limiting further losses. Dealers said that although the Dow's 192-point, 2.5-percent tumble would give the FTSE an early hangover, the UK blue-chip index has already fallen for six successive days and is well off its highs. Bid speculation was also seen providing some support. Most dealers expected an early mark-down of around 40 points but some were more relaxed, predicting the early damage could be as little as 20-25 points.

C13,C22,CCAT	 New Jersey Natural Gas Co said Wednesday the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved the company's Natural Solutions program which will bring more energy choices to homeowners. Through Natural Solutions, the utility said, its 335,000 residential customers will be eligible for two new service options on a first-come, first-served basis, up to certain annual enrollment limits. The program will also offer a new transportation service for small commercial customers to help them take advantage of deregulation opportunities.   The New Jersey Resources Corp subsidiary noted it was the first local distribution company in the state to bring real choices to all business owners in 1994. Services that will be offered through the Natural Solutions program include: -- A fixed price option for bundled residential utility customers -- those buying natural gas and delivery of the natural gas from NJ Natural Gas. Under this option homeowners within the utility's service area will be able to fix the unit price for their natural gas in advance for a one-year period.   Many unbundled commercial customers have done this since 1994. All 335,000 NJNG customers will be offered this service, but it will be limited to 20,000 customers over a two-year period. -- A supplier choice pilot program where residential customers in the utility's service are in the centeral New Jersey counties of Monmouth, Ocean, Morris and Middlesex would have the option to buy natural gas from a list of eligible, independent energy marketers. NJNG will continue to deliver the natural gas through its existing system to the customer's home, regardless of who supplies it.   The pilot will include up to 30,000 customers over the next three years, with the first enrollment beginning in April. -- Small commercial customers will be offered a specially-priced natural gas transportation service that will enhance potential savings from natural gas unbundling. This represents an expansion of the Company's existing transportation service. Currently, the commercial transportation and balancing service is priced to accommodate the transportation demands of the average commercial customer. Tailoring this service to the needs of smaller commercial customers makes it more cost-effective for them. -- Customers who want to maintain their current, bundled natural gas service from NJNG do not need to take any action to retain their service.

GCAT,GCRIM,GDIP	 Kenya's president handed over on Thursday to the Australian high commissioner in Nairobi an Australian pilot who was jailed in Somalia since May, diplomats said.   Australian High Commissioner John Trotter told Reuters the pilot, Justin Fraser, was brought out of Somalia by friends of Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and then flown to Nairobi on Thursday. &quot;I was called to State House (in Nairobi) and went to see the president who handed Fraser over to me so I just handed him over to his family,&quot; said Trotter, adding Fraser was thin but mentally alert although he appeared tired and needed to sleep. &quot;I am delighted and thankful to President Moi,&quot; Trotter added. Fraser had been held since May by a south Mogadishu-based faction led by Hussein Aideed, who succeeded his late father in August and had said in August the pilot might be freed after a review of his case. Fraser, 25, was forced to land at an airstrip in May in the western Somali town of Huddur and was sentenced to 25 years in jail and a fine of $485,000 in the southwestern town of Baidoa.
G15,G158,GCAT,GDIP	 Romania urged the European Union on Monday to open talks with all the central and eastern European countries queueing up for membership at the same time. Whether to open talks with all the 10 applicants, or just those that are properly prepared, is one of the EU's most pressing long-term foreign policy dilemmas. The EU intends to open talks six months after the close of its current inter-governental review of its workings designed to prepare the 15-nation bloc for the day it has around 25 members. &quot;We do hope that within six months all the candidate countries will be able to start the negotiations at the same moment,&quot; Romania's Foreign Affairs Minister Adrian Severin told a news conference after an Association Council meeting with EU foreign ministers. He said that while talks should start at the same time for all countries, each one should be admitted as soon as it has met the criteria for EU membership laid down by EU leaders. Romania, along with Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia and Bulgaria have all applied for EU membership. The EU's External Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek told the joint news conference that after previous governments in Romania had let the economic reform process necessary for EU membership slip, the new government had given it a new impulse. &quot;We very much welcome the new impetus given by this government,&quot; he said. EU foreign ministers, meeting informally in the Dutch town of Apeldoorn recently, agreed in principle to a standing conference on EU enlargement as a possible way of involving those not deemed ready for immediate membership talks.
M13,M131,MCAT	 The Croatian average lending rate rose to 11.7 percent on Thursday from 10.8 percent, boosted by a large volume of term loans made at higher rates.

Roughly half of them were call money loans, granted at a steady rate of 10.5 percent. &quot;But we had 11 million kuna term loans granted at higher rates, which pushed up the weighted average rate,&quot; one dealer said. Rates for two-week, one-month and one-year loans ranged between 13.5 and 15 percent. Insurers charged a steady nine percent for old money while banks extened previous loans at 14 and 15 percent.

Ravanelli, in Italy to prepare for the World Cup qualifier against Moldova on Saturday, said he hoped to discuss the prospect more when he returned to England and when his club's bosses were back from a tour in Thailand.

E51,E512,ECAT,GCAT,GDIP	 Iraq accused the United States on Tuesday of trying to disrupt the oil-for-food deal with the United Nations by placing obstacles to its implementation. &quot;The state of implementing (U.N.) resolution 986 and the memorandum of understanding it signed with the United Nations was going from bad to worse due to American attitudes aimed at delaying and disrupting (the deal),&quot; the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) said, quoting a letter from Iraq's U.N. ambassador Nizar Hamdoun to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Hamdoun accused Washington of being behind the delays in the arrival of adequate quantities of food and medical supplies to the Iraqi people. &quot;The United States has put on hold a great number of contracts without submitting a reason and when it provides a reason it is not plausible. On certain occasions it says the required medicines are not included in the memorandum and the number of ambulances are more than what is needed,&quot; Hamdoun said. Under the deal, signed last December, Iraq has been exporting limited amounts of oil worth $2 billion in six months to enable it buy urgent humanitarian needs for its sanctions-hit people. The deal comes under review on June 9. Hamdoun said Iraq had presented up until mid-May more than 570 contracts to the U.N. sanctions committee and only 217 went through. He said the United States either held up or cancelled 156 of them. Hamdoun urged Annan to use his good-offices with the United States &quot;to stop using methods of delay and procrastination which harm the Iraqi people and undermine the credibility of the United Nations and Security Council resolutions.&quot; INA, quoting its correspondent in New York, said Washington held up 19 contracts on May 15 &quot;for silly reasons&quot;, among them a deal to purchase pulses from Turkey and wheat from Australia. Iraq has repeatedly accused the U.S. of delaying the implementation of the deal and placing hurdles to scupper it. Iraq's ruling Baath party newspaper al-Thawra on Monday blamed the United States for the sluggish implementation of the pact, saying Washington was trying to disrupt the deal. It said the deal had failed to ease the hardships of Iraqis living under U.N. sanctions imposed for Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

M12,MCAT	 Portuguese bonds slipped in line with other southern European markets, troubled by fresh doubts over Europe's single currency and uncertainty about the outcome of early general elections in France. Dealers said prices were undermined by Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer's comments late on Monday that a delay in EMU could be considered if larger countries cannot meet criteria. &quot;Early elections in France and more worries about the single currency are pressuring 10-year bonds. Their spreads with Bunds won't go below 90 basis points,&quot; said one director of fixed-rate debt.
GCAT,GVIO	 Two more North Korean infiltrators were killed on Sunday during a fierce gun battle with South Korean security forces, the Defence Ministry said. A ministry spokesman said a South Korean soldier also died in the gun battle and another was injured. The spokesman gave no further details but an army officer said one of the North Koreans who was killed was dressed in a Southern army uniform and the other wore civilian clothes. The officer said a rifle and a grenade were recovered from the scene of the gunfight, which took place at dawn. The latest North Korean infiltrators to be killed were among the remnants of around 26 agents who landed by submarine in the early hours of Wednesday on a beach near the east coast city of Kangnung. South Korean forces have now killed nine of the agents and captured one alive, while the bodies of 11 others were found, possibly shot by saboteurs among the squad who wanted to increase their survival chances. The South Korean soldier was the second to die in two days. A paratrooper was shot and killed on Saturday during a helicopter chase for the North Korean agents across rugged mountains near Kangnung. Media reports said the 26-year-old sergeant was hit in the head while being winched to the ground to pursue two communist fugitives. Another paratrooper on the helicopter was also wounded as the infiltrators opened fire with automatic weapons. Thousands of South Korean security forces have been engaged in a massive manhunt to capture the remaining North Korean agents to end one of the deadlist infiltrations from the North since the early Cold War. South and North Korea are still technically at war after their 1950-53 conflict which ended only with an armistice agreement.
C11,C13,C24,CCAT	 Venezuela's Congress Tuesday delayed until March 4 its approval of a $3.5 billion Orinoco oil venture involving Atlantic Richfield CO (ARCO), Texaco, Phillips and state oil subsidiary Corpoven, congressional sources said. A clerical error meant that parliamentary deputies were not invited to an Energy and Mines Committee meeting which was due to approve the project. Virgilio Avila Vivas, president of the Senate Energy and Mines Committee, rescheduled the meeting for next Tuesday. Avila had previously expected to approve the project before the end of the current extraordinary session of Congress on March 2. The joint-venture aims to produce 197,000 barrels per day (bpd) of heavy crude from the Hamaca province of the Orinoco Tar Belt and convert it into 181,000 bpd of 25 degrees API crude. Corpoven and ARCO each have a 30 percent share in the scheme, while Texaco and Phillips each have 20 percent. ((--Tom Ashby, Caracas newsroom, 582 505 2611))
C15,C151,C1511,CCAT	 International accounting and consulting group KPMG said on Tuesday that its worldwide revenues for the 1996 fiscal year, ending September 30, grew by eight percent to $8.1 billion. &quot;The total represents overall growth of 8.0 percent, when compared with the firm's 1995 revenues of $7.5 billion,&quot; KPMG said in a statement.

C18,C181,CCAT	 Tax credits worth $550 million will cut the price Raytheon Co will pay for Texas Instruments Inc's defenese business to $2.4 billion, Raytheon Chief Financial Officer Peter D'Angelo said on Monday. &quot;The goodwill tax shield alone is worth $550 million in net present value to us, thus reducing the purchase price of the transaction, if you will, from $2.95 billion to something in the order of $2.4 billion,&quot; D'Angelo told reporters during a telephone conference call. D'Angelo said the takeover would not result in any layoffs at the Texas Instruments division.   &quot;While we expect some synergies in material procurement and R&amp;D, we do not see any adverse impact in employment at TI Systems because of the strong expected growth in revenues,&quot; D'Angelo told reporters. He said financing for the deal is also tax deductable, but he did not specify how that would impact the total cost for the Texas Instruments unit, to be renamed Raytheon TI Systems. D'Angelo said as a result of the tax deductability of the deal, contrary to analysts' initial impressions the takeover was done at a comparable price to other recent mergers in the industry.   On a gross price to operating profit ratio, after the tax deduction for goodwill, the cost for TI was 9.8 times trailing earnings, or 8.0 times 1997's expected earnings, he said. That is lower than the ratio for the recent mergers between Boeing Co and McDonnell Douglas Corp, Boeing and Rockwell International Corp aerospace and defense assets and the deal to form Lockheed Martin Corp, he said. &quot;In most of these transaction I just mentioned, goodwill was not deductable for tax purposes, so as you can see, we are below the range on a comparable basis,&quot; he said.   D'Angelo declined to say if Raytheon was specifically interested in next buying General Motors Corp's Hughes Electronics Corp, which is also up for sale. &quot;This transaction in no way precludes us from pursuing other opportunities,&quot; he said. &quot;Expected cash flow, good balance sheet and solid capitalization give us the flexibility to continue growing this defense electronics business. And as we have previously stated, we intend to continue growing our commercial operations.&quot; D'Angelo said he expected the deal to be closed in the second quarter and the company will then go to market to finance the debt. Raytheon's debt will balloon out to around $6.6 billion following the deal, but he said he was confident the company to pay down the $3 billion price for Raytheon within five years. &quot;We believe that we will have a very strong, investment grade rating when all the dust settles,&quot; he said. The goodwill tax writoff brings the gross price to revenue ratio, considering that revenues from the unit are expected to total $1.8 billion in 1997, down to 1.33 percent compared to 1.63 percent with the $2.95 billion price tag, he said. -- Boston bureau (617) 367-4176
C13,C22,CCAT	 Medtronic Inc said Monday it received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its Sprint Model 6942 tachyarrhythmia lead. The Medtronic Sprint Model 6942 joins the Sprint Model 6932 released last August.   Positioned in the heart and flexing each time the heart beats, leads are crucial to device therapy for cardiac arrhythmias, Medtronic said. A lead transmits signals to the implanted defibrillator about the activity of the heart's electrical conduction system and also delivers therapeutic impulses that return the heart to normal rhythm. &quot;The introduction of the Model 6942 lead increases the options available to physicians as they optimize the performance of any implanted defibrillator system,&quot; Jon Tremmel, president of the Medtronic Tachyarrhythmia Business, said in a statement.

But bonds were little changed as the market considered that the Fed might still raise rates later this month. The dollar rose above 110 yen for the first time in nearly two months amid remarks from a Japanese Finance Ministry official and speculation that low Japanese interest rates will continue to prompt investors to favour the dollar. The Dow Jones ended up 27.74 points at 5,754.92, not far from its record close of 5,778.00 set on May 22. In the broader market, advancing issues led declines 1,237 to 1,015 on active trading of 375 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. &quot;The bounce in the market is closely tied to the Beige Book. There was relief it was not stronger than it was and now people are back to thinking a 25 basis point (one-quarter percentage point) tightening or no change,&quot; said Michael LaTronica, director of research at Gruntal &amp; Co. The Fed in its so-called Beige Book report said the economy seemed to be expanding moderately with no clear sign of higher inflation, although wages appeared to be on the upswing. The report was based on information collected before Sept. 4 in the 12 Fed districts and will be used when central bank policymakers meet on Sept. 24 to plot interest-rate strategy. Analysts said the Fed's findings seemed to reinforce Wall Street's belief that the central bank will need to increase interest rates only modestly, if at all. The inflation-sensitive bond market held steady with the 30-year Treasury bond's yield at Tuesday's close of 7.11 percent. Traders were also bracing for the August Producer Price Index on Thursday, which is forecast up 0.1 percent for both core and overall rates, against an unchanged overall rate in July and an 0.1-percent rise in the core rate. On Friday, the Consumer Price Index is expected to show an increase of 0.2 percent in the core and overall rates versus an 0.3-percent rise in July. &quot;We'll have a much better reading on inflation and whether the Fed will raise rates after PPI and CPI,&quot; said Phil Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management. The dollar rose to 110.35 yen -- its highest since July 15 -- from 109.85 yen late Tuesday. The dollar was unchanged at 1.5110 German marks after rising for three days to 1.5155 marks early Wednesday, the highest dollar level since July 16. Crude oil and gasoline prices surged again after Iraq fired missiles at U.S. warplanes. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, October crude oil closed up 63 cents at $24.75 per barrel, after setting a contract high of $24.98 earlier. October gasoline closed up 1.06 cents at 65.91 cents per gallon, and October heating oil rose 1.52 cents to 68.19 cents per gallon. Traders at the New York Cotton Exchange bid cotton futures up the 3-cent-per-pound daily limit after the Agriculture Department slashed nearly 700,000 bales from its previous U.S. crop estimate. NYCE October cotton closed up 3 cents at 74.90 cents per pound. Overseas, London's FTSE 100 closed down 10.5 points at 3,905.6, after closing 2.7 points short of a new peak on Tuesday. In Tokyo, the key 225-share Nikkei average was up 11.45 points to end at 20,571.04.
M11,MCAT	 J.P. Morgan on Friday posted a bullish outlook for European equity markets in 1997, forecasting up to 20 percent growth and betting on Spain being among the first nations to join European Monetary Union (EMU). &quot;Lower than expected interest rates and our forecast of strong growth through 1997 and 1998 makes us positive about European equity markets for 1997,&quot; it said in a statement. &quot;We are forecasting returns of 10 to 20 percent, which we believe to be cautious.&quot; It added that its targets could be upgraded if its economic growth outlook was confirmed by a strong second quarter growth rebound. JP Morgan said it had reduced its weighting in Italy from overweight to neutral so as to strengthen its exposure to Spain on the expectation of Spain joining EMU in 1999. &quot;We have reinforced our weighting in Spain in the expectation of stronger growth and a good chance that Spain will enter EMU in the first round,&quot; it said. &quot;We are financing a higher weighting in Spain by cutting our weighting in Italy to neutral,&quot; it said, adding the peripheral markets would experience high volatility during 1997. A J.P. Morgan official said Italy's poor GDP growth rate would undermine its attempt to make significant progress towards Maastrict next year. It is forecasting 1.1 pct GDP growth for Italy in 1997 against 3.2 percent in Spain and a European average of 2.5 percent. JP Morgan said it would retain its core underweighting of France against an overweighting of Germany since Germany was likely to offer both growth and corporate restructuring. Restructuring was set to remain a major feature of the European corporate landscape during 1997, with significant dividend increases a possible surprise as companies return excess cash to shareholders. Sector selection would follow three themes -- buying into the growth rebound through cyclicals; slowly accumulating consumer stocks; and gaining exposure to restructuring or its payoff, it said. &quot;Our key 'Buy' recommendations are AGF, BASF, Danone, Elf Aquitaine, Metro and Norsk Hydro,&quot; it added. --Caroline Brothers, London Newsroom +44 171 542 2734

C42,CCAT,E41,ECAT,GCAT,GJOB	 Colombian public sector workers began a nationwide strike on Tuesday, disrupting air traffic, transportation, telecommunications and other services. Security was tight in the capital Bogota in what union leaders said could be the country's biggest labour dispute in 20 years. About 800,000 public sector workers were expected to join the protest action, union leaders said. The government warned that leftist guerrilla groups were planning a wave of attacks to coincide with the strike. But apart from the pre-dawn torching of a bus outside the central city of Ibague, there were no immediate reports of violence or serious acts of vandalism. National radio said that except for serious public transport shortages, services appeared to be functioning at or close to normal. However, the traffic flow in the capital was light, resembling a quiet Sunday afternoon rather than the usual hectic pace of a weekday. All state-run universities and schools were closed and long lines of people could be seen stranded at bus stops in working-class districts on the southern end of the capital. &quot;There's very little transportation this morning,&quot; said a woman waiting for a bus in the suburb of Soacha to take her to a cleaning job in the north of the city. Heavy detachments of riot police and army troops guarded public offices in the city centre -- where workers were expected to stage protest marches late on Tuesday. Police manned checkpoints along key roads in the capital. Ismael Enrique Arenas, a senior official with the state oil company Ecopetrol, said there was no immediate effect on exploration or production activity and administrative workers were filling in for trade unionists who joined the stoppage. Private oil companies working under association contracts with Ecopetrol were also unaffected, he told Reuters. State workers called the strike, which began at midnight Monday (0500 GMT on Tuesday) to press for a 21.5 percent wage hike. The government, struggling to cut its deficit, has vowed to hold workers' to a weighted 13.5 percent increase. Bogota police chief Gen. Teodoro Campo stressed &quot;absolute normalcy&quot; in the capital in an interview with national radio. Police helicopters clattered over the north end of Bogota, apparently on the lookout for urban rebel commandos, and a column of four light tanks and two armoured personnel carriers was spotted by a Reuters television cameraman heading for the southern gateway to the capital. Francisco Hernandez, a spokesman for Bogota's El Dorado international airport, said operations were &quot;more or less normal&quot; early on Tuesday. &quot;I only hope we'll be able to say the same by this evening,&quot; he told Caracol news radio. But some carriers, including Continental and American Airlines, suspended flights to Colombia as a security precaution since firemen had threatened to disrupt operations at the airport. Elizabeth Fuentes, a union leader heading a picket line outside a Bogota administrative building, said the strike would last indefinitely -- until the government bowed to demands for the wage hike and cancelled plans for the privatisation of national and regional industries. &quot;This strike is a protest against Samper's economic policy,&quot; she told Reuters. &quot;Those policies are anti-popular, they're policies against workers and against the Colombian people.&quot;

C13,CCAT,GCAT,GHEA	 New Jersey breast cancer patients would be assured that their health insurance would pay for at least two days in the hospital for surgery under legislation enacted by the Legislature Monday. The bill, sent to Gov. Christie Whitman, called for at least 72 hours after a modified radical mastectomy and 48 hours of hospital care for a simple mastectomy. The bill passed the state Senate Monday by a 37-0 vote. Gov. Whitman two years ago signed a bill requiring insurors to cover a two-day minimum hospital stay for mothers after giving birth.
M11,MCAT	 Indian global depositary receipts ended the week static after a lacklustre performance by local stocks and amid uncertainty about future direction, traders said. They said investors were showing little interest in the market following the resolution of the political crisis in the country, and prices would take the cue from stocks in India. Traders reported low volumes ahead of the weekend. They said concern in India that any further gains could soon be capped was keeping a lid on the GDR market, which ran up towards the end of last week, pulling GDR premiums up with them. SBI shed 12 cents to $24.00/$25.00 and VSNL lost 12 cents to $19.30/19.80. BSES was 56 cents higher at $22.00/$23.00. The HSBC James Capel Indian GDR index  JCEAI closed 0.03 points up at 80.09, with the premium over the local market at 19.78 percent from 19.98 percent. The Bombay Stock Exchange 30 share index shed 19.85 points to 3,825.57. The Capel Taiwan GDR Index added 1.25 points to 130.67 following further gains in local stocks, representing a discount to the local market of 2.23 percent.

GCAT,GDIP,GPOL,GVOTE	 President Bill Clinton has asked Richard Holbrooke, architect of the Dayton Peace Accords, to lead a delegation to observe the Bosnian elections, the White House said on Thursday. The Dayton accords, which were signed last November, brought an end to the Bosnian war and called for the holding of national elections in the region that were scheduled to take place this Saturday. The White House said in a statement issued in California, where Clinton was campaigning for re-election, that Holbrooke would lead a delegation of 13 members, including four U.S. congressmen. &quot;These elections are a key step on the long, difficult path to a lasting peace in Bosnia -- a path we are deterimed to walk alongside the Bosnian people in the days ahead,&quot; Clinton said in the statement.
M11	 German shares started floor trade mired in a narrow range on Wednesday as tension before Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony continued to unnerve the market. After a brief mini-rally on thin volumes in the early morning pre-bourse session, the DAX index of 30 blue chip stocks was down 5.21 points at 3,228.00 at 1002 GMT. The market was seen as unlikely to break out of its range before Greenspan's speech, after the Fed chairman in December sparked a global mini-crash on markets by warning against their &quot;irrational exuberance&quot;. Volumes were low and the overall market uneven, with some pressure on dollar-sensitive shares because of the dollar's slide to below 1.67 marks. Among auto stocks, dollar-driven Daimler-Benz AG was down 1.55 marks at 120.60 marks, while Volkswagen AG was down 8.0 marks at 790 marks after reporting disappointing 1996 results Tuesday. The outperformer of the day was pharmaceutical company Schering AG, which surged to a new all-time high of 153.20 marks in early trade and was up 6.40 marks at 152.60 marks at the start of bourse trading. Dealers said the company's news conference about its niche market strategies on Tuesday evening had boosted interest in Schering, lifting it to levels that also promoted technically driven buying interest. Schering had said on Tuesday that sales of its drugs to combat multiple sclerosis, leukaemia and other diseases should double in the next eight years.
C33,CCAT	 Fund manager Jardine Fleming Investment Management has been sacked from managing the pension funds of the prestigious Hong Kong Jockey Club, the South China Morning Post newspaper reported on Thursday. The fund manager lost the contract for managing funds worth HK$1.00 billion of the HK$1.8 billion fund after the club reviewed its performance and prospects, the paper said. Jardine Fleming executives were not immediately available for comment. Nor were Jockey Club officials. The paper quoted Paulus Lee, director of finance and central services for the club, as saying: &quot;Performance is one of the elements we use in making a decision about our fund managers.&quot; &quot;But it is not the only criteria. The safety of the assets and other factors would also have an influence,&quot; Lee said. Regulators hit Jardine Fleming, a joint venture between the Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd and Robert Fleming. with heavy fines and revoked the licence of its London-based fund management company, following revelations in August of late allocation of trades by a senior fund manager. Some of the trades involved the fund manager's personal trading account. The club, which holds the momopology on gambling in Hong Kong, has retained the services of its other two fund managers, Schroders and Fiduciary Trust, the newspaper reported. -- HONG KONG NEWSROOM (852) 28436441
M11,MCAT	 Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) began trading a new equity-linked note Friday and an exchange official said the market is ripe for other similar issues. Trading opened on Smith Barney S&amp;P 500 equity linked notes YSB.W Friday and volume totaled 15,400. The notes traded between 15, their initial offering price, and 15-1/8, ending at 15. One trader said activity was steady but not unusual for the first day of a new product. &quot;I did not anticipate a run on this,&quot; he said.   The YSB offering consisted of 4.39 million units. At the March 11, 2002 maturity, YSB holders will receive the principal amount plus a &quot;supplemental redemption amount&quot;. The amount, which will not be less than zero, would be based on the increase, if any, in the S&amp;P 500 index .SPX over the starting index value of 798.56, the CBOE said. The SPX closed at 804.97, up 6.41 points Friday. The Dow 30 average .DJI rose 56 to about 7,001. &quot;I don't know what the market's going to do, but when it's up at 7,000 (on the Dow), the YSB is a nice product,&quot; the trader said, noting investors will get back their principal.   Benjamin Krause, head of CBOE's capital market division, said the current investing environment, with low interest rates and benign inflation, made equity-linked products like the YSB attractive to some equity investors. &quot;These types of products fit the bill,&quot; he said in a telephone interview. &quot;We're apt to see more of these products.&quot; One new product CBOE plans to list is a call warrant issue on the Japan export index .JEX, which will be underwritten by Oppenheimer &amp; Co with ING Barings and Peregrine Capital as co-managers.   Industry sources said the target date to begin trading that product is March 26. Krause said new equity-linked products could be on either domestic or international indices. &quot;There's no question the market in general is very receptive to these types of products, whether it be linked to a domestic market index or perhaps other indices,&quot; he said. CBOE now trades four structured products and the YSB represents its first exclusive listing of such a product. ((--Gregory Crawford, 312 408 8750)) ((E-mail: derivatives@reuters.com))
GCAT,GSPO	 A moment of magic from either the 'Little Genius' or 'Killer' could settle Saturday's top of the table clash between Portuguese champions Porto and Benfica. The 'Little Genius' is Benfica captain Joao Vieira Pinto, whose mazy runs and sharp shooting can turn a match. The 'Killer' is Mario Jardel, the lanky Brazilian who is heading the list of goalscorers in his first season in the Portuguese league. They are indisputably the two hottest properties in a domestic championship which has suffered a haemorrhage of talent in the year since the Bosman ruling opened the European transfer floodgates. Benfica have reportedly turned down offers of up to 1.2 billion escudos ($8 million) for Pinto from across the border in Spain, with chairman Manuel Demasio saying that a vote by the club's membership would be needed for the striker to go. &quot;Joao Pinto is like our club banner. He is not for sale,&quot; Demasio said recently. Jardel, bought on a four-year contract from Brazil's Gremio in the close season, cost a Portuguese record fee of 750 million escudos ($4.8 million). Any club wanting to lure him away before the end of the century would have to offer some 50 percent more. &quot;It was a moment of madness,&quot; Porto chief Nuno Pinto da Costa said after shelling out the cash for the deeply religious Brazilian forward. But the tough-talking chairman could have had no regrets as two strikes by Jardel took Porto to an historic 3-2 away win against AC Milan in the European Champions' League earlier this season. The striker, who often starts matches on the bench, has found the net four times as Porto have strolled through the opening league phase of the 1996-97 European Cup to take a place in the coming quarter-finals of the competition they won 10 years ago. Regrets are reserved for Benfica. They had first option on the Brazilian but turned him down as too expensive. Mario Jardel Almeida Ribeiro, 23, has the killer instinct of the genuine striker -- hence his &quot;matador&quot; (killer) nicknaming by Porto fans -- with the knack of being in just the right spot at the right time. Tall at 1.88 metres, half of his 170 goals since turning a professional in Brazil in 1991 have come from headers. But he is also a swift striker of the ball with either foot. In contrast Vieira Pinto, 25, prefers to play slightly behind the front men to give himself room to run at the defence. He can be a difficult man to stop as the Germans discovered in a recent World Cup qualifier in which Portugal had the best of a 0-0 draw. As Portugal piled on the pressure in the closing minutes, only a fine save from German goalkeeper Andreas Koepke denied Vieira after he had dribbled across the area leaving five helpless defenders in his wake.

M14,M142,MCAT	 Japan's imports of refined copper and zinc under a once-a-year duty exemption scheme, announced on Wednesday, were well above market expectations, leaving many metal traders here puzzled and scrambling for explanations. Finance Ministry data showed copper imports under the scheme in fiscal 1997/98 totalled 75,631 tonnes, against forecasts of some 50,000, while zinc imports were 112,639 tonnes, up 34.8 percent from last year and well above market estimates of 80,000 to 100,000. Only lead imports fell from last year's levels, to 14,117 tonnes from 15,452. Refined aluminium ingot is not subject to Japanese tariffs. Japan's Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) scheme grants tariff exemptions to developing country imports submitted for customs clearance at the beginning of the fiscal year on April 1. &quot;I'm wondering how the figures turned out so high,&quot; said one trader. A zinc trader at a large trade house was worried the high volumes could lead to a sell-off later this year, as he expected domestic refined zinc in fiscal 1997/98 would cover all but about 130,000 tonnes of Japan's domestic needs. Yet he maintained his bullish short-term outlook on zinc prices, with his next target for London Metal Exchange benchmark three-month zinc at $1,330 a tonne. Zinc prices, supported by recent declines in LME warehouse stocks, bucked the weaker trend in other metals on Tuesday to end at $1,309, just below a new 4-1/2 year high of $1,310 hit earlier in the session. Despite the surprising level of GSP imports, Tokyo's spot copper and zinc markets remained quiet in the past week, although the aluminium market saw some deals done at a premium as high as $90 a tonne above LME cash prices, traders said. One aluminium trader said there was some Japanese buying on Wednesday because of the strengthening of the yen against the dollar. But consumers were still mostly buying on a hand-to-mouth basis as they expect prices would go down, he said. &quot;Consumers will buy if it keeps on dipping,&quot; he said, although he expected LME three-month prices would stay in their recent $1,600 to $1,700 a tonne range for a while. Latest indications of premiums at major Japanese ports on a CIF basis, in US$/tonne over LME cash prices, were as follows:      April 2      March 26  Copper (Grade A)   $60-$70      $65-$75  Aluminium (Good Western)     $82-$87      $83-$88  Zinc (SHG)    $80-$100     $80-$100 --Tokyo Commodity Desk +81-3-3432-6179

M13,M132,MCAT	 The Indonesian rupiah is likely to remain under pressure in the medium-term on bearish regional sentiment following last month's crash of the Thai baht, economists said. &quot;All depends on how far the Thai situation dies down,&quot; said Vincent Low, fixed income strategist at Merrill Lynch. &quot;The concern would dissipate once the pressure point in the region, which is Thailand, shows a sign of stability,&quot; he added. Thailand was forced by the market to devalue its currency following a heavy speculative attack sparked by the country's excessive foreign borrowings and weak banking system. Bangkok later turned to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for financial help. However, a stability package from the IMF was likely to bring short-term pain to Thailand and thus volatility to the market during the adjustment period, economists said. The market was waiting the release of Thailand's economic rescue plan, due by August 5, which was expected to include assistance from the IMF. &quot;Everybody wants to see what the IMF will do in Thailand on the fifth because that will indirectly affect all the other regional currencies,&quot; a Singapore-based currency trader said. Paul Soetopo, a director of Bank Indonesia, said last week that the rupiah had in recent days reached a normal level of between 2,555 and 2,610 to the dollar after reaching a low of 2,663 on July 21. He said the range was normal under current conditions. Low said the range would mean more or less a flat exchange rate for the rest of the year. &quot;It looks like a realistic six-month target, provided the Thai situation calms down. I think after that it will be status quo for the currency. Depending on sentiment, Bank Indonesia will attempt to guide it on a five percent (annual depreciation) path,&quot; Low said. Indonesia's central bank has been following a rupiah policy based on purchasing power parity (PPP) under which it has depreciated the rupiah against the dollar by about five percent per annum. PPP is a means of comparing living standards between nations. But it is also used as an indicator to value a currency. &quot;On the PPP basis, the rupiah seems to be under-valued,&quot; said Daragh Maher, economist of ING Barings. He added however that momentum and not fundamentals was going to drive regional currencies in the short-term. &quot;Given the lack of fundamental pressures driving the recent rupiah weakness and the degree of volatility, it's impossible to make a sensible forecast for the year-end exchange rate.&quot; But Maher believed that fundamentals had not deteriorated to such an extent as to warrant the degree of weakness seen in the rupiah during the second half of July. The rupiah, which started the year at 2,363 to the dollar, had fallen some 10 percent by Friday to about 2,600. UBS Global Research said in a recent report that the sharp depreciation of the rupiah was likely to have more than compensated for inflation rate differentials between Indonesia and its major trading partners. However, economists said one silver lining for Indonesia was that the overall weakness in regional currencies had meant they had more or less maintained their values relative to each other. &quot;Given that the baht and the peso have fallen, it (the fall in the rupiah) wouldn't hurt. It's good for the export picture for the rupiah to stay on the weaker side,&quot; Low said. Economists also added the currency impact on the economy appeared to be muted as inflation was calculated on domestically produced goods while imports accounted only for some 25 percent of GDP.

GCAT,GCRIM	 Twenty-two people, including 11 police officers and border guards, were brought to court in Hanoi on Friday at the start of a major drugs trial. Hundreds of people were gathered outside the Hanoi People's Court as a convoy of trucks and police jeeps carrying the defendants pulled up outside the building during the morning rush hour. Several senior drugs-squad officers at Vietnam's powerful Interior Ministry were among those on trial for involvement in an alleged international trafficking ring. Local news reports said some 47 domestic journalists were being allowed access to the trial, but foreign reporters were barred and the normal loudhailer relay of trial proceedings outside the court building was switched off. The scandal dates back to January 1995 when two Laotian nationals were arrested in Vietnam after they were found in posession of 15 kg (33 pounds) of heroin. One of the men, Sieng Pheng, earned a last minute reprieve from execution by firing squad in return for information which led to the arrest of around 30 people. A police captain among those implicated was quoted by a local newspaper earlier this week as saying he would expose some &quot;extremely important people&quot; during the hearing. The trial is expected to last about 10 days. In an interview ahead of the trial, the presiding judge said more than 10 people were likely to be sentenced to death.

C24,CCAT	 Royal Dutch/Shell said on Tuesday it would close two blending units in Belgium and the Netherlands as part of a major reorganisation of its European refining operations.   &quot;The blending units at Pernis (Rottterdam) and at Gent in Belgium will be closed by the end of 1998,&quot; said Henk Bonder, a Shell Netherlands spokesman.

The centre will be the principle source for the market in lubricants in France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. The centre in Hamburg will also be upgraded,&quot; said Bonder. Earlier, Shell announced it was to sell its 60,000 barrel a day Cressier refinery in Switzerland, continue efforts to improve the profitability of its Shell Haven refinery in England and evaluate its refinery needs in southeast France. Shell France is participating in an oil industry study, supported by the French government, Bonder said. The study is to be submitted by the end of January 1997. Shell has one refinery in the southeast of France, the 128,000 barrel per day Berre refinery near Marseille. -- Amsterdam Newsroom, +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040
M11,MCAT	 Philippine shares soared on Friday to their biggest day rise in percentage terms in nearly seven years after the peso plunged following a de facto devaluation of the currency. But the surge could be short-lived as a correction could set in and the movement of stocks next week would be determined by the foreign exchange market, analysts said. &quot;Obviously, the market cheered when the Central Bank allowed the peso to basically float. The concern in the past few days was that defending the peso by keeping interest rates high was too costly for market players,&quot; said Louie Bate, managing director for equities brokerage at ING Barings. The main index closed sharply higher by 7.57 percent, at 2,701.14 points. In terms of points, the 189.99-point gain was the biggest single-day rise in the market's history since December 1993 when the index surged 200.63 points at the close. &quot;The equities market reacted in anticipation of interest rates dropping to normal levels,&quot; said Amsteel Securities vice-president for marketing David de la Cruz. Overnight rates had more than doubled to 32 percent in the past two weeks as the Central Bank defended the peso. &quot;Naturally, when all this euphoria dies down, people will sift through the stocks. The weekend will allow investors to make further analysis on which stocks unjustly rose and those that would really benefit from a depreciation,&quot; said Bate. Asiamerit Securities senior investment analyst Ramon Saulo said that while Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co climbed 10 percent to 935 pesos on Friday on expectations of improved revenues from international calls, it may also suffer with the weakening of the currency. &quot;We should look out for PLDT since despite dollar-denominated revenues it also has dollar-denominated debt which last year alone comprised 84 percent of their debt,&quot; said Saulo. Traders said Friday's euphoric uptrend had pulled up even shares that were likely to be hit by the peso's fall. The Central Bank's announcement that it was letting the peso trade in a wider range came about an hour before the stock market opened. The decision meant an effective devaluation of the currency. The peso plunged 11.5 percent to 29.45 per dollar before the Bankers Association of the Philippines suspended trading for the day. &quot;The (stock) market's movement (next week) will depend on the exchange rate situation. We may likely face a correction because the market moved up too fast,&quot; said Wilfred Son Keng Po, chief operating officer at Angping &amp; Associates. -- Manila newsroom (632) 841 8934

C15,C152,C18,C181,C183,CCAT	 U.S. investment bank Merrill Lynch said on Monday it had downgraded its stock rating for Societe Generale to &quot;neutral&quot; from &quot;accumulate&quot; because of SocGen's interest in CIC, which is about to be privatised. The news confirmed information circulating in the stock market. Merrill Lynch noted that it was expecting lower second-half results than in the first half. SocGen stock was down six francs or 1.04 percent at 571 francs at 1116 GMT while the CAC-40 leading share index was down 0.11 percent.   The government is selling 67 percent of CIC, which is owned by state-controlled insurer GAN, and October 7 is the deadline for final bids. The central board savings bank grouping Caisses d'Epargne also meets on October 7 and is expected to decide then whether to bid. -- Paris Newsroom +33 1 4221 5452

C12,CCAT,GCAT,GCRIM,GPOL	 Spain's Supreme Court has decided to charge 26 people with corruption, among them top officials in the former ruling Socialist party, court documents published on Friday said. Guillermo Galeote, former finance director for the Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), and its former accounts director Aida Alvarez, were among those to be charged in the Filesa party financing corruption case, the court documents said. Seven people including two former Socialist parliamentarians have already been accused in the Filesa case, named after a front-company set up to channel funds to the party. The court also decided, in a meeting early on Friday, not to try any bankers or financiers in the case. The state prosecutor sayd 10 Spanish companies paid more than 1.08 billion pesetas ($8.7 million) to several front companies, set up by those who are to stand trial, for bogus studies and reports. In return they received government favours. The companies included Spanish banks Banco Bilbao Vizcaya and the former Banco Central, private oil company Espanola de Petroleos SA-Cepsa, bus and truck company Empresa Nacional de Autocamiones-ENASA, supermarket chain Centros Comerciales Pryca and construction company Fomento de Obras and Construcciones SA. The front companies -- Malesa, Time Export and Filesa -- were used to fund Socialist party election campaigns starting in 1989 with a general election and a European parliament poll, according to the state prosecutor. The scandal, which came to light more than three years ago, embarrassed the former Socialist government and contributed to its election defeat in March after 13 years in power. The state investigators were unable to establish, however, that the party's executive body had agreed to the scheme. After learning about the court decision, Socialist party spokesman Cipria Ciscar said the party respected the judicial process and asked for a speedy resolution. &quot;We are asking for swiftness in its judicial resolution,&quot; Ciscar said in a statement. &quot;The PSOE has always had respect for judicial decisions, in this case as in all.&quot;
M11,MCAT	 Austria's ATX index ended a shade lower on Wednesday after trading within a narrow range and traders see the market reined in at around 1,190 points. Turnover was generally moderate, although traders cited hectic activity in microchip producer AMS after reporting a dreary -- albeit largely discounted -- set of 1996 earnings and a dividend cut. The ATX index lost 1.21 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,184.92 points after trading within a 1,184.42 to 1,190.17 point range. Of its 21 constituents, eight gained, 10 fell and three were unchanged. &quot;On the whole it was a quiet day today. Vienna didn't really follow the basic bullish tone around,&quot; said one trader, adding that on the customer side there was more a feeling of holding back. Demand centred on engineering group VA Tech and building materials firm Wienerberger, both of which are scheduled to release 1996 earnings later this month. VA Tech was the day's best performer, adding on 1.87 percent to 1,732.9 schillings. AMS was the most actively traded, and at one point the biggest gainer, on turnover of 49,121 lots. The stock ended 16 schillings higher at 1,090, off a session high of 1,146. Traders said the poor AMS figures were expected and already factored into the share price. The market also took a positive view of an increase in Q1 1997 order entry and the reduction of its stake in its loss-making South African SAMES. One trader said that the two-schilling cut in dividend to 10 schillings &quot;was not totally unexpected and anyway with a stock that sees such price fluctuations, a two-schilling smaller dividend is hardly a subject.&quot; The day's worst performer was beverage group BBAG, down 2.1 percent at 700 schillings. Creditanstalt shares were mixed after the bank confirmed positive 1996 earnings data and reported a record Q1. Preferred shares finished up 0.9 schillings at 457.90, while the ordinaries lost six to 717.00. The all-share Vienna bourse index fell 1.29 points, or 0.29 percent, to 448.32. The April ATX future gained 3.7 points to 1,188.5 on turnover of 656 contracts. -- Vienna newsroom, +431 531 12256
C13,CCAT,E21,E211,ECAT,GCAT,GPOL	 The Clinton administration Thursday proposed $390 million in user fees that would cover the cost of putting federal inspectors in meat, poultry and egg plants. &quot;The proposal would require industry to reimburse the government for the salaries, benefits and related costs associated with in-plant inspection,&quot; budget documents said. &quot;This proposal would ensure that sufficient resources are available to provide the level of in-plant inspection necessary to meet the demands of the industry.&quot; The proposal was the farthest-reaching yet in efforts by the government to offset the cost of meat inspection. In the past, it suggested having industry pay for overtime or for more than one shift a day at a plant of federal inspectors. The White House said it had to resort to user fees because of the pinch on resources caused by anti-deficit laws.
GCAT,GVIO	 More than 10,000 residents braved rain and took to the streets of rebel-held Goma in eastern Zaire on Tuesday to hear rebel chief Laurent Kabila vow his forces would take over Africa's third largest country. Kabila, head of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), was speaking three days after his rapidly advancing guerrilla force captured Kisangani, Zaire's third largest city. He promised a temporary ceasefire for 20 km (13 miles) around Kisangani to allow in humanitarian aid and let people who fled return, but said advances elsewhere would continue. &quot;Everything was looted in Kisangani and we invite all humanitarian organisations and the United Nations to go there to help our people,&quot; Kabila said. Kabila singled out the panic-stricken capital-city Kinshasa and the central diamond-mining city of Mbuji-Mayi as next rebel targets. He said his forces were within 400 km (250 miles) of Mbuji-Mayi where he said Zaire's ragged army fled after abandoning Kisangani. &quot;They will flee from there as they have fled before, what can they do to protect something which cannot be protected, we hear they are already laying down their arms,&quot; Kabila said. &quot;We want to liberate Kinshasa and the people there need us...Kinshasa will fall,&quot; Kabila told the crowd in the eastern border town that is the seat of the rebel administration. Military sources in the region said Kabila's forces were also advancing in mineral-rich Shaba province -- where they seized towns of Kalemie, Moba, Pweto and Manono without a fight -- and were within 400 km (250 miles) of the capital Lubumbashi. They said Kabila's forces also appeared to be heading for towns near ailing and absent President Mobutu Sese Seko's jungle palace at Gbadolite, near the Central African Republic. The crowd cheered as Kabila said until French policy changed there would be no room for it in a Zaire under rebel control: &quot;We will bury French people if they try to come here again and take our country from us, we are waiting for them.&quot; France is Mobutu's last backer in the western world. Paris has tried unsuccessfully to get an international force to help Rwandan Hutu refugees trapped in the conflict. Kabila's rebels scored their biggest success on Saturday by capturing Kisangani, the base for a failed counter-offensive by the army. Primary school children in cold and wet uniforms gave a two-finger victory salute to Kabila as they marched past his canopy to the beat of a local band. Merchants marched with samples of their wares held above their heads -- some carrying pineapples, bananas and avocados, to show their solidarity with the rebellion. &quot;What does the rain matter, we have to show Mzee Kabila the (old man Kabila) how happy we are to have been liberated,&quot; said Lambert Kabuye, shivering under the cloudburst. Dressed in animal skins, the same local drummers who sang the praises of Mobutu when he visited Goma, were on hand to play for eastern Zaire's new ruler. Kabila's forces have won over a fifth of Zaire since they launched their military campaign last October, sparked by attempts to expel ethnic Tutsis to Rwanda, an ancestral home they left more than 200 years ago.
E21,E212,ECAT,M12,MCAT	 Brazil plans to issue a 150-200 million stg, 10-year Eurobond via Barclays de Zoete Wedd and CS First Boston in early July, the Central Bank said. In a statement, the bank also said it would not issue a Euroyen bond for the time being. The bank said it had received recommendations from Japanese financial institutions regarding the possibility of issuing a Euroyen bond, but the bank decided to &quot;wait for a more opportune moment to enter this market.&quot;
GCAT,GDIP,GPOL,GREL	 The office of Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, predicted on Saturday that China would violate human rights and trample democracy once it regains control of Hong Kong. &quot;In Hong Kong, human rights and democracy will be the first casualty of reunification with China,&quot; the Dalai Lama's office in the Indian capital said in a 15-page statement on Hong Kong's reversion to China at midnight on June 30. The statement said Chinese rulers could not be trusted to keep their promises to ensure a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong under an arrangement called &quot;one country, two systems&quot;. It said &quot;one can't help wondering if China can be trusted to adhere to any agreement which does not serve its purpose,&quot; accusing Beijing of violating a 1951 accord which it said promised the same one-country, two-systems formula for Tibet. The Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, fled his homeland to India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule. Currently over 100,000 Tibetans live in exile in India. Tibet and China signed a 17-point agreement in 1951 that promised to leave Tibet's political, cultural and religious system unchanged by communist reforms. But the Dalai Lama's office said China violated &quot;each and every provision of the agreement that was favourable to Tibet&quot;. It said China had proposed a similar agreement with Taiwan, but the Taiwanese rejected it. The statement said &quot;the people of Hong Kong would do well to understand the Taiwanese fear&quot;. It said &quot;the Tibetan experience with the 17-point agreement does not give the people of Hong Kong much cause for optimism. As it is, China has already started interfering politically in the economic life of the territory&quot;. The statement said China would replace Hong Kong's democratically-elected legislature with one dominated by handpicked nominees. It said Hong Kong's future chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, &quot;has alluded that human rights and democracy activists will find the going tough under the new masters&quot;. &quot;His (Tung's) proposals for legal reforms provide for the curtailment of democratic rights and civil liberties in the territory,&quot; it said. The statement said China did not have a history of tolerating dissent and criticism. &quot;Is it, therefore, any wonder that fears for a Tiananmen Square-type massacre persist despite the assurance of Tung-Chee-hwa to the contrary?&quot; It was referring to the crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989. Hong Kong will be the litmus test for China's willingness to allow the devolution of power, the statement said. &quot;If Chinese leadership could demonstrate the necessary vision and wisdom, it will undoubtedly open up better prospects for resolving outstanding problems like Tibet,&quot; it said.

C13,C18,C181,CCAT	 Bell Atlantic Corp and NYNEX Corp said they applauded the decision by the U.S. Department of Justice to okay a merger of the two Baby Bells to form the nation's largest local phone service provider. The companies noted they now require only the U.S. Federal Communications Commission go-ahead before closing the deal. In a statement, Ray Smith, Bell Atlantic's chairman and chief executive said that, &quot;We're extremely pleased with the Department of Justice's decision, which came after a comprehensive and thorough review.&quot;   &quot;Our merger will continue to open communications markets -- local, long-distance and video -- and help realize the promise of the 1996 Telecom Act,&quot; he said. Earlier Thursday, Smith had told reporters that he expected the government to attach no conditions to Bell Atlantic's proposed merger with NYNEX. NYNEX Chairman and Chief Executive Ivan Seidenberg said in the same statement that, &quot;The merger of Bell Atlantic and NYNEX will promote customer choice, innovation and economic growth in the communities we serve.&quot; &quot;We are looking forward to the integration of our companies and the launch of the new Bell Atlantic,&quot; he said. The proposed merger between Bell Atlantic and NYNEX was announced almost exactly one year ago on April 22, 1996. The combined corporation, to be named Bell Atlantic and headquartered in New York City, will provide 39 million telephone access lines and serve nearly 5 million wireless customers in 13 states, the District of Columbia, and in a variety of overseas operations. The merger has received approvals from all necessary state regulatory authorities, and shareowners of both companies approved the merger at special meetings in November 1996. (( -- E.

C18,C181,CCAT	 Swedish insurer Skandia said on Monday it had increased its holding in Finnish insurance group Pohjola to 10.9 percent of the capital and 7.8 percent of the votes in the company. Skandia said it had no plans to increase its holding in Pohjola further.   &quot;At present there are no plans to further increase Skandia's holding in Pohjola,&quot; the company said in a statement. Skandia said the increased ownership came about by Skandia exchanging 1.08 million Pohjola B-shares for Pohjola A-shares in the market. &quot;The change of class of shares in Pohjola ... is a move to manifest our confidence in Pohjola and our intention to remain as long term owners in the company as well as to follow more closely the on-going structural changes in Finland,&quot; it said. Skandia's newly appointed president and chief executive, Lars-Eric Petersson, said the two companies have collaborated in the Nordic market for a number of years. This has led to cross-ownership between them. Pohjola's holding in Skandia amount to 10.5 percent of the shares and the votes. -- Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700 1017

E12,ECAT,G15,G151,G154,GCAT	 Finance Minister Antonio Sousa Franco said he was confident Portugal would join the European single currency at its launch despite recent remarks by a German official that some countries were not ready to take part. &quot;(State Secretary at the German Finance Ministry) Juergen Stark, who is an important man in this process, made a speech aimed at markets in defence of the mark,&quot; Sousa Franco told a parliamentary commission on European affairs. &quot;This is a political game. German industrialists and others are very frightened of Italy joining (the euro),&quot; he said. Stark said last week that some countries should foresake the political prestige of joining the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) from the outset in 1999 if their economic structures were not ready. He did not name names but his comments appeared to be directed at so-called &quot;Club Med&quot; countries, including Portugal, which have not yet established a track record of exchange rate stability. Sousa Franco said he thought Stark's remarks were aimed at Italy. &quot;This is a manoeuvre to neutralise internal German opposition, but it is the question of Italy that is up for discussion in 1997,&quot; he said. &quot;When they make these comments they are not thinking about Portugal at all, for reasons which are crystal clear. We have shown that we have (economic) sustainability,&quot; he said. &quot;We must have the sense to see that this is Italy's battle but that we are on the battlefield and we must defend ourselves.&quot; He said Italy was making a big effort to meet the EMU criteria, adding: &quot;Nothing will be achieved in Europe without Italy or against Italy.&quot; Sousa Franco said that the recent volatility of the escudo, which has followed the peseta lower, was a slight upset but would have no impact on the downward trend in interest rates. &quot;Interest rates are tending to stabilise in Portugal but they could go down further,&quot; he said. But the minister warned that currency and money markets could see increasing volatility in 1997 and 1998. &quot;When George Soros carries more weight than Helmut Kohl -- and Soros has already shown he weighs more than sterling -- then this is a very dangerous atmosphere,&quot; Sousa Franco said. He was referring to the Hungarian-born financier who is credited with having almost single-handedly driven the British pound out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992. On Monday Soros said that markets need not panic if Italy and Spain missed the start of EMU. -- Lisbon editorial +(351-1) 3538254
GCAT,GPOL,GVIO,GVOTE	 Serbian opposition leader Zoran Djindjic called for national elections in Serbia on Monday, saying he was sure President Slobodan Milosevic would not win. In an interview with the ARD television network, Djindjic, who heads theZajedno (Together) opposition coalition, called on the Serbian authorities to reverse their annulment of opposition victories in local elections held last November. He said protests against the Serbian authorities' refusal to recognise these victories, which reached the 77th day on Monday, would continue. &quot;The first step (toward democratic reform) would be to recognise the results of the election, the second would be to establish media freedom, the third -- to hold proper elections for this year,&quot; he told ARD. &quot;In this way Milosevic will be out. He is an obstacle for reform,&quot; he said, speaking in German. &quot;We see him (Milosevic) as a problem for the country. We must solve this. He should go, otherwise the country can not go on.&quot; Djindjic said he was confident that a general election would produce victory for Zajedno. Anti-riot police carried out overnight attacks on demonstrators. The repeated baton charges and clubbing injured at least 100 people in the worst violence seen in Belgrade for years. The decision by Milosevic to unleash his internal security police, many of them drawn from outside Belgrade, on demonstrators after three months of largely peaceful protests drew swift condemnation from Western powers.
C24,CCAT,E11,ECAT,GCAT,GPOL	 A potential new source of revenue -- oil -- offers hope of a fresh start for Chad's fragile economy as it rebuilds after three decades of war. &quot;Soon work will begin,&quot; Foreign Minister Saleh Kebzabo told Reuters recently. &quot;Chad should get some royalties so we can free the country through development.&quot; Chad has known coups, civil war or conflict with its northern neighbour Libya for much of its life from independence in 1960. Sporadic cross-border rebel raids remain a problem. But after July's presidential election won by former warlord Idriss Deby, who seized power in a 1990 French-backed coup, there are signs of durable peace and opportunities for growth. Deby's Patriotic Salvation Movement is strongly placed to win a comfortable majority in the new national assembly which will convene on March 31 after runoffs on February 23. &quot;Some public spirit is needed and southerners must have a feeling of sharing wealth,&quot; said one French diplomat. &quot;Deby has kept a peace for nearly six years and he now also has a political mandate.&quot; Oil offers the main hope for the 21st Century, with local units of Exxon (Esso Exploration and Production Chad Inc.), Shell (Societe Shell Tchadienne de Recherches et d'Exploitation) and ELF (Elf Hydrocarbures Tchad), prospecting in the south and west. Little has leaked out about terms and royalties. Chad's projected revenue from its first oilfield at Doba, which has reserves estimated by Exxon at 900 million barrels, are also unclear. Production is planned to run for 15 to 20 years from 2001. Backers of the project plan to build a 650-mile (1,060 km) pipeline to tanker terminals in Cameroon. FEAR OF CORRUPTION FROM OIL WEALTH The discovery of oil has raised fears of mismanagement or corruption. &quot;I am frightened about the oil. The experience of most African countries is that it is mismanaged,&quot; Kebzabo said. But donors say oil should give Chad, which has only 300 km (190 miles) of paved roads, a chance to develop infrastructure, public services and particularly education. Chadians and businesses can also expect a brighter future and cheaper overheads from a combined fuel and power plant project to be fed by oil or gas from the Sedigi field in the west. A 12 MW heavy fuel power plant with possible gas feed is expected on line by 2000 in association with a mini-refinery. &quot;We hope to cut electricity costs to French levels from among the world's highest,&quot; said the refinery project finance director Souradj Koulamallah. Donors have been backing economic and political reforms and business and development projects to boost Chad's main export earners -- cotton, livestock and gum arabic. World Bank loans include $430 million for structural adjustment, among other things, to improve public finances and improve the environment for private business. France has chipped in with a 60 million French franc ($11 million) grant and will offer a further 45 million French francs if Chad sticks to International Monetary Fund proposed reforms. World Bank figures give gross domestic product per capita in 1995 of $170. On the negative side, external debt rose to $817 million in 1996 from $803 million in 1995 and 1996 GDP growth was projected at 0.5 percent, down from 4.5 percent in 1995. The population of 6.5 million grows by 2.5 percent a year. DROUGHT LEADS TO FOOD SHORTAGE Inflation fell from 40.4 percent in 1994 to 10 percent in 1996 but Chad's World Food Programme bureau points to food shortages after drought cut cereal output by eight percent. High overheads and devaluation of France's CFA franc in 1994 squeezed small businesses. France's Caisse Francaise de Developpement (CFD) development agency has frozen lending to many small and medium-sized firms. But the outlook seems rosier for Chad's main export, cotton. State monopoly COTONTCHAD expects a record 205,000-tonne crop and higher world price rises in 1997. Low prices and little or no textile manufacturing to add value have kept income down. Livestock prices are rising despite drought and Chad, its neighbours and donors are studying ambitious irrigation projects. The United Nations and France are backing projects to develop gum arabic -- a natural stabiliser used widely in the food and drinks industries but until recently eclipsed by synthetic substitutes. Both predict renewed demand and higher prices. Chad's 80 percent rural community is plagued by drought, with cereal food shortages forecast for 1997. Poor roads are seen as partly at the root of food shortages in some regions. Crops can be cut off in storage by rain for up to four months a year when some tracks are ordered closed.

C13,CCAT,M11,MCAT	 China's two stock exchanges on Friday ordered brokerages to make public to retail investors the top stock gainers and losers and the names of the firms most actively involved in trading them, exchange announcments said.   The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges in similar announcements said they would transfer information to brokerages about the five top gaining and losing stocks in each trading day which move more than seven percent in either direction. The brokerages must make the information public in their business halls through notices or on large electronic boards so that ordinary investors have access to the information, the announcements said. The exchange will also make available to the brokerages the names of institutions most actively involved in trading the top stocks. Brokerages must pass them to the retail investors in the same way, they said. The announcements said the date for the implemention of the new rule had yet to be settled and would be announced later. The exchanges on Friday also set daily movement limits for all shares and investment fund units at 10 percent in either direction with effect from next Monday. Brokers said the measures were taken after dramatic rises and falls in prices of securities on the exchanges in recent months.

M11,MCAT	 Bucharest share prices shot up on Tuesday in a bullish trend which gripped the market five sessions ago. Turnover soared by around 73 million lei to 158.3 million. &quot;High inflation last year prompted the rally, making prices of 5,000 lei per share ridiculously low,&quot; said a trader. Year-on-year inflation was 56.9 percent in December, almost double an anticipated rate of 30 percent. &quot;Also, the depreciation of the leu has had an impact on the market,&quot; another trader said. The leu currency has fallen by around 35 percent since January 1 to a present interbank rate of $1=5,450/500. Brokers said fresh investment in the market had revived trading, which was sluggish for most of last year. &quot;We can talk of institutional investors now and, finally, of foreign investors who have been absent from the market so far,&quot; said a broker. &quot;The new, reformist government seems to have been good news for foreign investors,&quot; he added, referring to a centrist coalition which took power after polls last November. Brokers said turnover would have been a lot higher if there had been more offers. &quot;Investors bought everything thrown into the market, the offer for most stocks was nil for half today's session,&quot; one said. Brokers said they expected the bullish mood to continue on Thursday and then to be followed by profit-taking. Fertiliser maker Azomures SA dominated trading, with 86 percent of turnover.

E31,E311,ECAT	 French industrialists were expecting a moderate rise in activity in the coming months, especially in the agri-food and consumer goods sectors, but a fall in the auto sector, said a Bank of France October survey released on Monday.   &quot;In the coming months industrial activity should continue to improve at a moderate pace. The most significant rises expected are in the agri-food and consumer goods industries while a drop is expected in the auto sector,&quot; the central bank said. Industrialists, surveyed in October, registered a small improvement in production capacity utilisation and better overall demand, with demand in France helped by increased orders in advance of year-end festivities, the survey said. Foreign demand firmed, with strengthening northern European orders and a lesser impact from southern European competition due to appreciation of currencies in that region, it said. &quot;Order books, which have yet to reach normal levels, added weight overall across the sectors, especially in consumer goods. Stock levels, which still look higher than desirable, eased in most sectors,&quot; it added. It said the price of finished goods fell in the car and capital goods sectors, held relatively firm in the rest of the sectors, due mainly to better demand. It said investment expenditure remained the reserve largely of big companies with productivity gains in mind but that plans for 1997 had not yet been fixed. Staff levels declined slightly, mainly in construction, but the agri-food sector saw a slight increase, it said, adding that companies had increasingly turned to short-term contracts, temporary work agencies or work-hour variations to deal with the seasonal increase in end of year activity. -- Paris Newsroom +33 1 4221 5452
M11,MCAT	 The Athens general share index ended 3.13 percent higher and analysts said market sentiment was strong after news of OTE telecom's second flotation and easing March CPI-inflation were released on Friday. Greece will sell another 10.7 percent of OTE telecom in June followed by a 7.5 percent rights issue 15 days later. If demand proves strong it may up the float by an additional 2.0 percent, National Economy Minister Yannos Papandoniou said. OTE shares hit an all-time record high, closing at 6,300 drachmas on Monday. &quot;Investors started buying shares of OTE and Intracom, Alcatel and Hellenic Cables,&quot; said analyst Costas Lygizos, at Egnatia Funds. It is obvious that OTE's second flotation has uplifted market sentiment, he added. &quot;There have been rumours in the market about OTE's pricing, at 6,000 drachmas,&quot; he said. Easing interest rates and March inflation have also boosted the market, he added. &quot;After the 1,435 level was broken during the session, a new resistance level is expected at 1,450 points. This level has been attained before, towards the end of February,&quot; he added. Another analyst said he expected the rise to spread across-the-board. &quot;Banks are leading the rally. But I believe that with many companies having strong 1997 profit forecasts, the rise will eventually spread across-the board,&quot; said analyst Sotiris Halkiadis, at Athinaiki Securities. The Athens general share index settled 3.13 percent or 43.72 points higher at 1,439.41 from Friday's 1,395.69 close, after opening at 1418.63. Turnover rose to 21.3 billion drachmas on volume of 5.6 million shares. Advancers led decliners 171 to 64, with 21 issues unchanged on 256 traded. Construction and banks led Monday's rally, rising 4.04 and 3.21 percent respectively. Industrial stocks gained 3.29 percent and investment shares closed 2.12 percent higher. Small caps settled up 0.51 percent.
C13,C31,CCAT	 Indian Finance Minister P. Chidambaram was quoted on Sunday as saying the government was considering raising the prices of petroleum products to cover the burgeoning cost of petrol subsidies. &quot;The events have overtaken us,&quot; the Press Trust of India (PTI) quoted Chidambaram as telling TVI Network. &quot;The price of crude, instead of coming down as expected, has shot up to $24 a barrel. Someone has to pay the bill. This (petroleum product price increase) is being considered by the government.&quot; Chidambaram was quoted as saying the previous government of former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, which was turned out of power following general elections in April and May, had made the mistake of not raising petroleum prices. The finance minister said Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's United Front coalition government had taken the &quot;courageous step&quot; of raising petroleum prices shortly after taking power in June. Last week share prices on the Bombay Stock Exchange were hit by reports that an increase in petroleum prices appeared certain. The Indian Express newspaper said the Petroleum Ministry had sought the cabinet's approval to raise the price of crude oil paid to state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd. The paper said the ministry had sought a rise in the price of crude oil extracted by the oil-producing companies to 1,991 rupees per tonne from 1,741 rupees. But the Petroleum Ministry later said there was no plan for an immediate increase in petroleum prices. The government reimburses oil firms for the difference between what they pay to import crude and what domestic refiners pay them. Ministry officials estimate that the oil pool deficit is expected to touch 155 billion rupees in 1996/97 (April-March) against 57 billion rupees last year. -- New Delhi newsroom +91-11 301 2024

GCAT,GVIO	 Papua New Guinea troops killed nine civilians and wounded five in a mortar attack that hit a church on the secessionist-racked island of Bougainville, an Australian newspaper and rebels said on Friday. The attack on Malapita village in rebel-held Bougainville occured last Thursday when villagers were gathering in church for morning prayers, The Australian newspaper's South Pacific correspondent in the nearby Solomon Islands reported. The newspaper said witnesses evacuated to the Solomons' capital Honiara confirmed the attack and the deaths. One of the injured, Kauvina Tom, who suffered shrapnel wounds to her thighs, told the newspaper the mortars were fired from the nearby army-controlled Buin Care (Refugee) Centre. &quot;We saw seven mortars come from the Buin Care Centre, but only two came through the roof of the church,&quot; Tom said. The mortar bombs exploded on the floor of the church in the middle of the congregation, she said. &quot;It was a surprise that the (PNG) defence force decided to attack us because we were in the church,&quot; Tom said. The rebels' Bougainville Interim Government issued a statement in Sydney saying more than 20 civilians, including children, had been killed in the past two weeks by troops and government-backed resistance fighters on Bougainville. The statement lists the names of the nine killed and five wounded at Malabita in south Bougainville. It also said that on December 1 in Mokakuru village in southwest Bougainville, troops killed 11 people, some as they slept, and wounded 11. &quot;We fear there could be more killed, but we are still trying to get more information,&quot; rebel government spokesman Moses Havini told Reuters in Sydney. Colonel Jack Tuat, chief-of-staff of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force, told Reuters he was not aware of the Malapita attack. &quot;There have been no directions for special operations which would require the use of mortars,&quot; Tuat said in the capital of Port Moresby, 800 km (500 miles) southwest of Bougainville. &quot;The nearest army post is out of range of the church area. But we are trying to confirm with the field forces,&quot; Tuat said. Francis Ona, rebel president of the interim government, said in a statement that Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan had totally lost control of his military on Bougainville. &quot;It seems that the PNGDF are trying to kill as many civilians as possible before they are withdrawn from Bougainville,&quot; Ona said. &quot;We now have an unruly bunch of undisciplined marauding killers that are making Bougainville their killing fields.&quot; An official inquiry into the assassination of Bougainville premier Theodore Miriung on October 12 implicated seven soldiers and called for a troop withdrawal. Tuat said a 30-man unit was being withdrawn from Bougainville. &quot;The whole unit is being recalled, not just those implicated,&quot; he said.

M13,M131,MCAT	 Short-term trading rates on Zimbabwe's money market were quoted firmer on Monday, responding to Friday's announcement by the central Reserve Bank that it would raise it's rediscount rate. The central bank said it had been forced to hike the rediscount rate two percentage points to 25.5 percent by a recent wave of consumer prices increases, high money supply growth and expected wage increases which could all fuel inflation. Inflation rose to a 10-month high of 22.4 percent in the year to April from 19.9 percent in March, and market analysts said the benchmark rediscount rate should also go up in tune and allow other interest rates to follow suit. &quot;Now there's definitely going to be more activity on the market with more buying of paper. People were reluctant to buy paper because they were anticipating a rise in the rediscount,&quot; one local money dealer said on Monday. But he said trade was still on the quiet side, and the central Reserve Bank did not auction any treasury bills to mop up liquidity despite an opening surplus of Z$482.6 million. The bills were however being traded on the secondary market at 23 percent from Friday's 22.75 percent while call money edged up to 23 from 21 percent. NCD bills with maturity of 30, 60 and 90 days were being bought at 26 percent from 25 and sold a percentage point firmer at 24.5. Bank acceptance bills were quoted at 25.5 percent from 24 percent (buying) and sold at 24 percent, up from 23. --Stella Mapenzauswa, Harare Newsroom: +263-4 72 52 7/8/9
GCAT	 NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Six non-life insurance firms affiliated with life insurance companies and the Zenrosai (The National Federation of Workers and Consumers Insurance Cooperatives) group will sell vehicle insurance from April 1. Life insurers hope their units will gain about one trillion yen a year from the business. The parents are: Nippon Life Insurance Co, Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co, Sumitomo Life Insurance Co, Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co, Mitusi Mutual Life Insurance Co and Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance Co. ----   A government task force will propose a cut of around 10 percent in premiums for mandatory vehicle liability insurance from May. It would be the first cut since 1993. ---- Toppan Printing Co Ltd plans to spend a record 100 billion yen on plant and equipment in the year to March 1998, to strengthen its electronics division, computerise and streamline its printing operations, and increase factory automation. It also plan to spend more than 80 billion yen annually over the three years from April 1998 to March 2001. ----
GCAT,GPOL,GVOTE	 At least a fifth of Scottish electors have yet to decide which party to vote for in the May 1 general election, according to the latest opinion poll. Among those who have decided, Labour gained one to 52 percent support and the Scottish National Party (SNP) also gained one to 24 percent. Britain's ruling Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats both lost one to 13 and nine percent respectively. The weekly System Three poll published in the Herald newspaper on Wednesday was carried out in 40 of Scotland's 72 parliamentary constituencies from April 12-14. Just a fortnight before polling day, Conservative support was down to only half its 26 percent vote in the 1992 election with Labour well above its 39 percent then. Labour had 49 Scottish seats, Conservatives 10, Liberal Democrats nine, and SNP four in the old parliament. The Herald said the latest poll showed little change in party fortunes over the past week. The significant figure was the rise of undecided voters to 20 percent from 14 percent in the last monthly poll on March 9. Its survey is at variance with an ICM poll published by the Scotsman newspaper on Tuesday, which showed Labour five down to 42 percent and Liberal Democrats up the same amount to 15. Conservatives slipped back one to 19 and SNP gained one to 23. The Herald said the differing results could come from different sampling methods. System Three uses face-to-face quota interviews and ICM carries out a random telephone survey.
GCAT,GSPO	 Rising British tennis star Tim Henman and Swiss prodigy Martina Hingis completed dream countdowns to the Australian Open on Saturday by winning the men's and women's finals at the Sydney International. Henman, 22, claimed his first professional title by beating Spain's Carlos Moya 6-3 6-1 less than a week after playing in his first career final in Doha, Qatar. Hingis, in her third tour win, stopped former American child star Jennifer Capriati 6-1 7-5 6-1, reclaiming the last title she won before her three-year absence from the game, In his second final in six days, Henman started as favourite against baseliner Moya, a 20-year-old who is one of 14 Spaniards in the top 100 ranked men. Moya made a strong start, breaking Henman in the third game of the first set with powerful and precise groundstrokes. Henman broke back decisively and dominated the match from then on, taking 11 of 13 games to wrap up within 54 minutes. Constantly varying his pace and length, he closed Moya down with well-placed volleys from the net and some acute passing shots. He broke the Spaniard's service three times in the second set, including winning the seventh and final game to love. The win will place Henman 14th or 15th in the rankings, making him the first Briton to crack the top 20 since Buster Mottram in 1983. It also means that his three stated ambitions for 1997 -- to make the top 20, to win a tournament and to become a regular finalist -- have already been met two weeks into the year. He said his substitute target would be a place in the top 10. He is the first British male to win at the Sydney tournament since Vaughan Wilberforce Eaves in 1902 -- and he was born in Australia. Henman has a first-round date with Australian giant Mark Philippoussis, one of the biggest hitters in the sport. The women's final was a match full of resonances. Capriati, now on the comeback trail, became the youngest women's champion in Sydney in 1993 at the age of 16 years and nine months, She lost that record to Hingis, aged 16 years and three months but with two full years of tour tennis behind her. It was the first time Capriati had faced the player who took her place as the sport's youngest major star and has eclipsed many of her age records. Apart from a spell in the second set, however, when Capriati played some beautifully-controlled shots to come back from 1-4 down to win 7-5, Hingis was dominant. &quot;Four years ago she was the title-holder and now she's struggling and I'm in the same place -- it's weird,&quot; said Hingis, adding that Capriati had nevertheless played &quot;a great match&quot; against her. &quot;I'm younger than Jennifer but right now I think I'm more experienced,&quot; she said. Hingis is seeded fourth in the Australian Open, which starts on Monday, but is seen by many as the woman with the best chance to beat world number one Steffi Graf of Germany. &quot;I'm still 16, I have nothing to lose,&quot; she said. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800

M11,MCAT	 Most Croatian stocks were lower on Tuesday, but boosted turnover and gains in blue chips indicated recovery was on the cards, traders said. &quot;Most prices have reached lowest levels and it is time they moved upward,&quot; one major trader told Reuters. Six of 11 active issues fell, three rose and two were flat. But turnover doubled to 10.2 million kuna on a slightly lower volume of 9,852 units. Fully listed Zagrebacka Banka accounted for more than one third of the day's trade, selling 3,948 shares. It closed 220 kuna higher after trading mixed in 1,780-1,850 kuna range. Zagrebacka's 1/10 GDRs rose to $31.43 from Monday's close at $31.25 on Seaq International. Another blue chip, Pliva pharmaceutical, added five kuna to close at 430 kuna after a mixed trade in 420-430 kuna range. Volume rose to 2,520 units after a week of relatively thin trade. Its GDRs which represent 1/5 of each share, rose to $14.63 on the London Stock Exchange from $14.56 on Monday. &quot;Prices for both stocks are relatively low now,&quot; the trader said, adding that he foresaw no significant changes in the immediate future. He put their good trading down to investors' expectations of good annual results, which both companies are due to publish in April. Chocolate maker Kras, which inched up 15 kuna to 465, led the gainers but sold only 105 shares. Food processor Podravka lost 1.1 kuna to 299.9 kuna with 2,172 units changing hands. Another trader said its price was not likely to slide further. Tuesday's biggest decliner was hotelier Istraturist, dipping 15 kuna to 155 on volume of 61 shares. The most active among hoteliers was Laguna, which lost 24.9 kuna to 1,405, with 711 shares sold. &quot;There is room for its price to go up,&quot; the first trader said.
M11,MCAT	 Danish share prices slipped in early trade on Friday with dealers seeing more modest falls ahead in a thin market with purchase orders few and far between and the outlook unsure. &quot;Order books are empty so it is hard to see what is going to spur the market on.

The KFX top-20 index had lost 0.16 point to 152.50 at 0720 gmt, having closed 0.78 point higher on Thursday. --Chris Follett, Copenhagen newsroom, 45-33-969652

C13,CCAT,M13,M131,MCAT	 Chicago Mercantile Exchange said it filed for regulatory approval to trade futures and options on Mexican Treasury bills (CETES) and Mexican Equilibrium Interbank Rate (TIIE). &quot;Strong customer demand prompted the CME to consider offering Mexican interest rate products based on one- and three-month maturities,&quot; CME Chairman Jack Sandner said in a statement. &quot;And trading in CETES and TIIE contracts will complement the Merc's robust trade in Mexican peso futures and options,&quot; Sandner added.   The CETES contracts will be based on the 91-day CETES (Certificados de la Tesoreria de la Federacion), which are discount bills similar to U.S. T-bills, the exchange said. The TIIE contracts will be based on the 28-day TIIE (Tasa de Interes Interbancario de Equilibrio), a rate determined by Banco de Mexico, Mexico's central bank, based on supply and demand for wholesale bank loans, CME said. CETES futures will have a contract size of two million pesos, while TIIE contracts will be sized at six million pesos. A start date for trading will be set pending approval by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CME said.   The new contracts will be part of CME's Growth and Emerging Markets (GEM) division, launched last year. The exchange already trades derivatives on the Mexican peso, Mexican par Brady bonds and the Mexican IPC stock index. --Chicago Derivatives Desk 312-408-8750 E-mail: derivatives@reuters.com

The Denver, Colo., luggage company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it will itself sell 3.0 million shares in the offering.

C21,CCAT	 Passenger rail service resumed in the tunnel under the English Channel Wednesday, although riders were scarce due to lingering safety concerns after the fire last month that injured 34 people and forced the tunnel to halt operations temporarily. Train operator Eurostar resumed passenger service between London and Paris and Brussels a few hours after safety officials said they were satisfied with evacuation procedures and safety equipment in the 32-mile tunnel. The tunnel had been closed to passenger traffic since Nov. 18, when a fire on a truck destroyed a freight train, injuring 34 people and severely damaging a section of tunnel. Only one of the two tunnels under the sea is being used. The damaged tunnel remains closed while it undergoes extensive repairs from the fire, which burned cables and buckled track. Trains will alternate through the remaining tunnel. Freight traffic resumed a few days after the fire and passenger vehicle shuttles are due to resume Dec. 10. Freight vehicle shuttles of the type on which the fire occurred will resume only after a French investigation of the accident is completed.
C24,CCAT	 The Sleipner East and West condensate and gas fields in the North Sea will close for scheduled maintenance between August 7 and August 19, operator Den norske stats oljeselskap AS (Statoil) said on Thursday. In June the two developments had an average throughput of 169,543 barrels of condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs) per day, according to Statoil's latest figures. Gas from the two fields is sold under the Troll sales agreements. Condensate is piped to the Kaarstoe terminal on the west coast of Norway. --Oslo newsroom, +47 22 42 50 41

C15,C151,C1511,CCAT	 Spanish Uniban bank, recently absorbed by Morocco's Wafabank, showed 1996 audited losses equivalent to $15.3 million, a bank spokesman said on Thursday. The bank registered losses equivalent to $2.9 million in 1995, the spokesman said. &quot;It was mainly due to provisions,&quot; he added but gave no details. Last year, Wafabank decided to buy 100 percent of Uniban or more than 2.46 million shares priced at about $28 million, a Casablanca-based market analyst said. It offered one share in exchange for five shares of Uniban despite some opposition from minority shareholders, the analyst said. The minority group which holds around 7.0 percent of Uniban stock continues to dispute the takeover issue before a Casablanca court, he added. Earlier this month, Wafabank said it made a net profit of 242 million dirhams ($25.7 million) in calendar 1996, up 20 percent on the 201 million dirhams of the previous year. A private Moroccan group owns 50.4 percent of Wafabank and another 10.4 percent, previously held by French Groupe Suez, was ceded last July to Indosuez Bank group. The remaining 39.2 percent of Wafabank's equity is publicly owned. The dissolution of Uniban and its delisting from the Casablanca stock market after its absorbtion by Wafabank is expected by June 1997, a bourse official said. Wafabank and Uniban are among the 47 companies listed on the 68-year old Casablanca bourse. The two stocks were respectively traded on Thursday at 750 dirhams and 148 dirhams.

C13,C31,C41,C411,CCAT	 Polish Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz on Tuesday suggested he could dismiss the management of the state-owned PZU SA insurer if it fails to convince him its motor liability premiums rise of 43 percent is necessary, PAP news agency said. Last week Powszechny Zaklad Ubezpieczen SA (PZU), which has an 80 percent share in Poland's obligatory motor insurance market with 9.5 million customers, announced it would raise the premiums as of December 27. &quot;I intend to either change the decision...or to hold responsible the people who took the decision,&quot; PAP quoted Cimoszewicz as saying. He added that he could not see any good reasons for the decision, but he would meet the PZU president Jan Monkiewicz to hear out his arguments. PZU earlier said the move was forced by a more than 41 percent rise in obligatory motor insurance claims in the last two years caused by booming new car registrations and worsening road safety. On Friday Cimoszewicz asked the Anti-Monopoly Office to check whether PZU's decision was monopolistic practice. -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700

C11,C22,CCAT	 Sprint Corp and NorAm Energy Management Inc, an unregulated marketing affiliate of NorAm Energy Corp, said Tuesday they will test market for six months packaged energy and communications services. Sprint long distance services will be provided to NorAm business customers in two regions of Ohio and one region of Massachusetts. Sprint is one of the first communications companies to package services with those of an energy company. During this six-month test period, which will conclude at the end of October, NorAm will offer to its unregulated, commercial customers Sprint long distance service as a packaged product along with gas services. &quot;The potential for large scale business and technological synergies between major players in the energy and communications industries is already apparent, particularly in deregulated energy markets. NorAm is now rapidly exploring that market potential,&quot; said Steve Husband, marketing director for NorAm Energy Management. Sprint said it is currently is exploring this type of relationship in other regions of the United States. NorAm Energy is the nation's third-largest natural gas distribution company, serving nearly three million customers through its Arkla, Entex and Minnegasco distribution divisions.

E12,E21,E212,ECAT	 A proposed new issue of International Monetary Fund Special Drawing Rights to selected members must not come under the guise of an unjustifiable general issue, the Bundesbank said on Wednesday. In its 1996 annual report, the central bank said there was broad support for an issue of SDRs to countries which have never held SDRs or hold only a small volume of the currency, but added that the volume of such an issue was still undecided. Countries which have joined the IMF since the last SDR issue in 1981 have never been issued with the balance-sheet currency, despite their IMF membership. &quot;The most important thing from the German point of view is that a special issue of this type should not take place in reference to a general global liquidity need ('long-term global need') which is the only admissable grounds for a general issue under the terms of the existing IMF agreement,&quot; it said. &quot;It would not be possible to explain such a need convincingly given the liquidity available in financial markets and it could also not be justified from the standpoint of price stability,&quot; the Bundesbank said. Germany has repeatedly opposed a general issue of SDRs to all IMF countries. The Group of Seven industrial nations joined together at an IMF meeting in Madrid in 1994 to reject a proposal for a general issue of this type. --Janet Northcote, Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525
GCAT,GDIP,GVIO	 United Nations special envoy Mohammed Sahnoun called on Friday for the major powers to put &quot;firm pressure&quot; on all sides involved in the Zaire fighting to lay down their arms and join peace talks. Sahnoun, just back from the Great Lakes region where he also represents the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), told a news conference that unless the conflict was stopped it could spread across Africa and even affect the global economy. &quot;The situation is much worse than I had thought,&quot; said Sahnoun, a former U.S. special representative in Somalia. &quot;The strongest possible pressure must be exerted by the international community, especially the members of the (U.N.) Security Council, on all the protagonists to lay down their arms and take part in peace negotiations,&quot; he declared. &quot;Everyone who has a responsability for the maintenance of peace must send a firm and coordinated message to all the participants in this conflict: stop fighting. &quot;If this is not done, we are all responsible for the tragedy that will follow.&quot; The conflict is centred in eastern Zaire where insurgents opposed to the administration of President Mobutu Sese Seko have seized a large swathe of territory. The Zairean government accuses Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi of supporting them. Sahnoun said that apart from the &quot;real tragedy&quot; in the east of Zaire where half a million refugees from Rwanda are located, in Rwanda and Burundi the world was &quot;sitting on a volcano which could erupt possibly any minute.&quot; &quot;If the fighting (in Zaire) is not stopped, destabilisation could spread right through to the Horn of Africa through Uganda and Sudan,&quot; said Sahnoun. The situation could also have repercussions on world markets by limiting supplies of raw materials and metals from the region. &quot;It is in the interests of the world economy to find a solution,&quot; he added. Sahnoun, a former Algerian diplomat, said that if fighting was not stopped, &quot;intervention by force&quot; might become necessary. &quot;As a last resort, we might have to look at this,&quot; he said. &quot;But the moment has not yet come. We still have room to try to get a cessation of hostilities and start up dialogue.&quot; Sahnoun did not say who might intervene or provide troops for an intervention force. Until now, most countries in Africa and beyond have been reluctant to commit forces for a situation in which they might become involved in peace-enforcement.

GCAT,GSPO	 Poland breezed past Georgia 4-1 in their World Cup European zone group two qualifier on Saturday. Poland, who stay third in the group eight points behind second-placed England, made the most of their opportunities to score their first goals in four World Cup qualifiers this year, despite going a goal behind in the 24th minute. Georgia striker Shota Arveladje found the net from an acute angle but Poland struck back quickly with goals in the 33rd and 35th minutes by Adam Ledwon and Miroslaw Trzeciak. Captain Krzysztof Bukalski added a penalty in the 70th minute and Krzysztof Nowak tapped in a cross a minute from the end to complete the scoring. Poland fielded a drastically reshaped squad in their first game under head coach Krzysztof Pawlak, who took over from Antoni Piechniczek following Poland's 2-0 loss against England last month, which ended their chances of advancing to the finals in France. Teams: Poland: 1-Grzegorz Szamotulski, 2-Pawel Skrzypek, 3-Mariusz Kukielka, 4-Radoslaw Michalski, 5-Radoslaw Kaluzny, 6-Tomasz Sokolowski, 7-Krzysztof Bukalski, 8-Adam Ledwon, 9-Jacek Dembinski (15-Waldemar Adamczyk 87), 10-Krzysztof Nowak, 11-Miroslaw Trzeciak (18-Cezary Kucharski 60).

E11,ECAT	 Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Wednesday that September GDP data showed the Australian economy has continued to grow strongly and that the figures were consistent with budget forecasts. &quot;Today's national accounts show that the economy has continued to grow solidly, with GDP rising by 0.8 percent in the September quarter and 3.8 percent in the year to the September quarter,&quot; Costello said in a statement.  Costello said the outlook for public spending was at least as strong as the government had forecast and that investment was leading economic growth. The data also was consistent with budget employment forecasts, he said.  &quot;While it is clear that production conditions remain mixed across sectors, growth in manufacturing was a solid 2.4 percent, with particularly strong growth in machinery and equipment production,&quot; Costello said. &quot;Activity in transport and storage was also strong, as was growth in communications which rose 1.5 percent in the quarter and by over 11 percent through the year to September,&quot; he said.  &quot;However, an easing in consumer demand from the very strong rates of the last couple of years appears to have slowed growth in the retail trade sector,&quot; Costello said. &quot;The main contributions to GDP growth came from continued strong growth in business investment, a substantial net export contribution, some increase in non-farm stocks and moderate growth in private consumption expenditure,&quot; he added. Public consumption fell, he noted.  Costello said strong growth in business investment of about eight percent reflected growth in both equipment and construction investment of seven percent and 10.5 percent respectively. He said this had confirmed the underlying confidence of business in the government's policy settings and the underlying strength of the economy.  &quot;Today's outcome also highlights the dangers in trying to use partial data, such as capital imports, as a guide to trends in aggregates such as business investment,&quot; Costello said. He noted the fourth capital expenditure survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed expectations about 20 percent above a year ago and eight percent higher than the third estimate for 1996/97. &quot;Together, these data lend strong support to the budget forecast for business investment,&quot; he said. &quot;The national accounts are also consistent with the budget forecasts generally,&quot; he said. Costello said the fall in public spending in the quarter was not surprising, given the volatility of the public expenditure data. Stronger growth in the sector was expected in coming quarters, he said. Costello said the housing sector appeared to be playing out to expectations with activity stable and a gradual pickup in activity expected in coming quarters. &quot;The national accounts clearly highlight Australia's status as a low inflation country - the private consumption deflator rose by only 0.2 percent and the deflator for gross national expenditure fell, reflecting lower prices for imported capital goods,&quot; Costello said. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800

C12,CCAT,GCAT,GCRIM,GHEA	 An addiction expert called by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. testified Wednesday at a closely watched wrongful death trial that smoker Jean Connor was not an addict and that he did not view nicotine as a &quot;potent drug.&quot; Dr. Domenic Ciraulo, a Boston University psychiatrist, was the last witness to be called by lawyers for Reynolds, which is defending a lawsuit brought by Connor's sister, Dana Raulerson. Connor began smoking as a teenager and built a three-pack-a-day habit before she died of lung cancer at age 49. Raulerson sued for wrongful death on behalf of Connor's estate and her three children. Ciraulo testified that the scientific press had dubbed many things addictive, including caffeine, the Internet, sex, food, alcohol, psychoactive drugs, television, love, work, shopping, tanning, video games, exercise and weight loss. But he said Connor -- who in depositions before her death testified that she was addicted to cigarettes -- did not qualify as an addict according to criteria described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, a text used by psychiatrists to define and classify addictions. Ciraulo said smoking did not interfere with Connor's social activities or work, and when she quit smoking -- in 1993 because she wanted a tummy tuck and her plastic surgeon would not do it while she smoked -- she did not report withdrawal symptoms. &quot;Jean Connor made one successful effort to cut down,&quot; Ciraulo said. Ciraulo, who has treated drug addicts, said he did not consider cigarettes to be addictive. On cross-examination, Raulerson's lawyer, Norwood Wilner, asked Ciraulo about a 1972 internal Reynolds document in which a company researcher referred to nicotine as &quot;a potent drug.&quot; Ciraulo said he disagreed with that description of nicotine. &quot;I would never phrase it that way,&quot; he said. When Wilner asked if cigarettes deliver a &quot;dose&quot; of nicotine, Ciraulo said the word dose referred to medication and he preferred to use &quot;amount.&quot; Raulerson's lawyers have repeatedly called cigarettes &quot;drug delivery devices&quot; to back one of their key contentions, that Connor was addicted to a drug. Reynolds, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., was expected to rest its case early Thursday, at which time rebuttal witnesses would be called. Judge Bernard Nachman was expected to hold a lawyers conference Thursday afternoon to decide on the instructions to be given to the jury. Closing arguments were tentatively scheduled for Friday morning and the jury could begin deliberations Friday. Lawyers said each side would be given two and a half hours for closing statements.

Cocoa butter sellers were offering a lower butter ratio to offset the impact of higher futures and the strong British currency but mark prices were still unattractive, traders also said. They were sceptical of fundamentals factors cited as responsible for the futures surge such as a statement from the Ivory Coast there was no more cocoa left to sell.

GCAT,GCRIM	 China's southern Guangzhou city has executed 43 criminals in a single day and a court in central Hunan province has sentenced two state workers to die for their role in an explosion that killed 122 people, state media said. Court officials at seven public rallies across Guangzhou city, capital of booming Guangdong province, sentenced 43 people to death on Tuesday for crimes ranging from murder to robbery and blackmail, the Yangcheng Evening news said. The convicted criminals were taken to execution grounds and shot shortly after sentencing, the newspaper said in a report seen in Beijing on Wednesday. Court officials also sentenced 80 other criminals at the rallies, it said but gave no details. A court in central Hunan sentenced two government workers to death for their part in the accidental detonation of an illegal explosives cache last January that obliterated a five-storey building and killed 122 people, the China Youth Daily said. Final sentences against driver Shi Zhiqiang and state bank official Liu Liping were issued by the Hunan Higher People's Court last week, the newspaper said. Liu and Shi had been involved in blackmarket trading of explosives along with chief suspect He Geng before a 20-tonne store of dynamite hidden by He in the basement of an apartment block exploded on January 31, it said. It did not say if the death sentences against Liu and Shi had been carried out. He, who state media has called China's most wanted man, was still on the loose, it said. The court jailed 15 other people -- some of them for life -- for involvement in the case or for helping He to flee, it said.
GCAT,GSPO	 Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati moved closer to their first showdown since 1992 by advancing in the $450,000 Ameritech Cup tennis tournament on Thursday. Seles, who shares the world number one ranking with Steffi Graf, defeated Irina Spirlea 7-6 (7-4) 6-2 in the quarterfinal round, taking advantage of 33 unforced errors and 12 double faults by the Romanian. Capriati, ranked 50th and a late entry in the Chicago event, upset number eight seed, defending Chicago champion Magdalena Maleeva 6-3 5-7 6-1 in the second round. Capriati, who missed two years on the tour because of personal problems and injuries, will face unseeded Meredith McGrath Friday in the quarterfinals. The winner of that match faces Seles, who is playing in her first tournament in a month after taking time to rehabilitate a shoulder injury. The four-week absence is a brief layoff for the 22-year-old, who was sidelined for more than two years after being stabbed in the back at a tournament in Germany in 1993. Both she and Capriati are enjoying successful returns. &quot;I haven't played Jennifer since we both have come back,&quot; Seles said. &quot;I really don't want to think about it yet.&quot; The two have not squared off since the quarterfinal round of the 1992 French Open, which Seles won 6-2 6-2. Seles has a 5-2 lead in career matches against Capriati. A marquee Seles-Capriati match would certainly benefit the tournament, being played at the University of Illinois-Chicago Pavilion. Chicago has been a stop on the women's tour since 1973 and despite having the best field in years, with six of the top 10 players entered, crowds this week have been embarrassingly small. &quot;I think women's tennis needs to do something,&quot; said Seles, who told of people stopping her in downtown Chicago, asking why she was in town. &quot;When we play in Europe and Japan, we play before a full house.'' One problem could be the star players' lack of interest. Seles asked tournament officials to arrange the schedule so she could attend the defending NBA champion Chicago Bulls' home opener Saturday night. Seles did say she felt the men's tour has shifted more tournaments overseas because of the large crowds, increased interest and bigger purses. However, she avoided offering any specific suggestions for the women's tour. Capriati's return will certainly help. In her second-round match, the 20-year-old American outdueled Maleeva with her deep groundstrokes. &quot;I think I let her in a little bit and let her dictate some points (in the second set),&quot; Capriati said. &quot;I wasn't doing anything and then I picked it up. I thought I should play my way instead.&quot; &quot;Maybe she was tougher than I was,&quot; said Maleeva, who was just glad to be playing because of a back injury that has limited her practice time. Every win helps Capriati. &quot;I feel more positive about my game and more confident, that hey, I can play this game,&quot; she said.

GCAT,GDEF,GDIP	 IZMAIL, Ukraine, July 4 - Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma believes a special charter to be signed with NATO next week will enhance his country's security and reinforce its identity in Europe. In an interview with Reuters late on Thursday, Kuchma also said the NATO deal would boost the former Soviet republic's strategy of integrating with European institutions. &quot;I am sure Ukraine's security will be increased,&quot; said Kuchma, attending a two-day summit with presidents Emil Constantinescu of Romania and Petru Lucinschi of Moldova in the Danube port of Izmail. &quot;First, because this document consists of security guarantees. Second -- and this is one of the most important things -- it recognises us as a country of Central and Eastern Europe,&quot; he said. &quot;In this way, we are invited into Europe&quot;. The pact, initialled in May and due to be signed at a NATO summit in Madrid on July 8-9, is called the &quot;Charter on a Distinctive Partnership between NATO and the Ukraine&quot;. It sets up a series of mechanisms including an exchange of military missions, with NATO establishing an office in Kiev, ambassadorial meetings once a month and a bi-annual NATO-Ukraine Commission which will provide a vehicle for consultations at times of regional crises. Kuchma sees it as a continuation of Ukraine's campaign to join Europe, signalled last year when he said its strategic goal was to join the European Union. In the last two months he has attended a string of regional summits in a bid to show Kiev's desire to boost ties with Europe and cut its umbilical cord to Russia. Russia signed a &quot;Founding Act&quot; with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in May, but Ukrainian officials see it as a &quot;document with a spirit of confrontation&quot;. They point out that Moscow is still opposed to NATO enlargement and see the pact between the two as a reconciliation of opponents rather than a deal between friends. Kiev, third in line after Israel and Egypt for aid from Washington, which has a strategic interest in strengthening its independence, stresses its NATO charter will be in a spirit of partnership. Unlike Moscow, which dominated Ukraine for more than three centuries, Kiev does not oppose NATO enlargement and has recently shifted its position to open support for Central and Eastern European countries becoming members. Ukraine was the first member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) grouping former Soviet republics to join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme. It has boosted its profile in security structures by fulfilling a peacekeeping mission in Bosnia over the last five years, the last two years of it under NATO command. In addition, Ukraine, which became the  world's third biggest nuclear power after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, last year completed the removal of all nuclear warheads from its SS-19 and SS-24 long-range missiles. Although officially a member of the CIS, Ukraine has never joined its Moscow-led Collective Security Pact, nor has its parliament ratified the CIS membership charter. Ukrainian diplomacy has been anxious to get a formal deal with NATO and pressed for Kuchma to be invited to the Madrid summit, where he is due to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Foreign ministry sources say the charter would not legally oblige the alliance to defend Ukraine if it was threatened, a pledge usually offered to fully-fledged members of NATO. Kiev has not applied for membership of NATO but senior officials have suggested Ukraine might try to join after 2000. Asked whether a time would come for Ukraine to abandon its official non-bloc status and neutrality to become a NATO member, Kuchma said: &quot;There is nothing eternal in the world.&quot;
C15,C151,C1511,CCAT	 German telecommunications group Deutsche Telekom AG said on Tuesday that 1996 group net profit was af 1.8 billion marks and profit on ordinary activities was at 6.6 billion marks. Group sales totalled 63.1 billion marks. The company gave no comparisons for the previous year, but it was expected to provide adjusted 1995 data at a news conference later in the day. The 1996 data reflected the first year that Telekom paid value added tax. The 1995 figures need to be adjusted as if the tax were paid, in order to provide comparisons with 1996. The company said in a statement that it reduced its liabilities by 12 billion marks in 1996, of which 1.2 billion marks were paid before becoming due. The workforce fell by 12,500 employees to 201,000 at the end of December.   Commenting on the first quarter of 1997, Telekom said preliminary data showed group sales rose eight percent to 16.3 billion marks and pre-tax profit was 2.2 billion marks. It gave no comparisons. Group liabilities were reduced by 2.6 billion marks. The workforce totalled 199,000 employees at the end of March, down 2,000 from the end of December. The company plans to reduce the workforce to 170,000 by the year 2000. Telekom also repeated its goal of paying a dividend of 1.20 marks on 1997 results after 60 pfennigs in 1996. The company is majority-owned by the German government, but over 25 percent of its capital was listed on stock exchanges in November. -- William Boston, Bonn Newsroom, 49 228 26097 145

GCAT,GSPO	 The sacred turf of St Andrews' Old Course became the unlikely scene of a golfing rarity -- a bitter exchange between two players -- when U.S. money leader Phil Mickelson and Swede Jarmo Sandelin clashed at the Dunhill Cup on Sunday. World number nine Mickelson accused his semifinal opponent of a lack of sportsmanship and said he was upset by Sandelin's celebrations every time he made a putt. The American felt Sandelin was being disrespectful -- and told him so. &quot;On the 12th tee Mickelson came to me and said 'You should show me some respect and don't behave like that',&quot; Sandelin, who has played on the U.S. Tour this year, said. &quot;He said this is a friendly game. I said I know it is but I want to win my game. &quot;Then he criticised my play in the U.S. Tour this year,&quot; Sandelin said. &quot;I know I have been playing badly there and that's true. But just because he's in the top 10 in the world rankings doesn't mean he can say things like that.&quot; Sandelin, five under par through 12 holes, said he was happy to make his putts &quot;and I probably showed it. But I did nothing really. I just showed I was pleased when I holed the putts. &quot;He was four behind and maybe it made him upset. We shook hands at the end. I think he was over-reacting.&quot; Sandelin won the match 68-71 but the U.S. won the semifinal tie on victories by Mark O'Meara and Steve Stricker over Peter Hedblom and Patrick Sjoland respectively. Mickelson said his remarks were sparked by Sandelin's reaction to the Swede's extra hole defeat of Zimbabwe's Nick Price on Friday. The 26-year-old American refused to discuss the events at the 12th directly but said: &quot;I feel the Dunhill Cup, Ryder Cup and President's Cup are wonderful events that promote sportsmanship and camaraderie internationally. &quot;I think it's important to keep those events in high esteem and to promote good sportsmanship.&quot; Mickelson said that when Sandelin beat Price &quot;it could have been handled better than it was by the Swede. &quot;I think Nick Price is a wonderful diplomat to the game of golf and I think he has been nothing but nice to me and to everybody else. &quot;I feel that our match could have been conducted with a little more sportsmanship and I was disappointed,&quot; he added. But the two players patched up their differences afterwards. &quot;Everything is fine now,&quot; Mickelson said. &quot;He's a wonderful player. It is too bad he won't be able to keep playing on the U.S. Tour because he wasn't able to keep his card. &quot;I'm sure he'll have a wonderful year next year on the European Tour.&quot;
C14,C15,C152,C17,C171,CCAT,M11,MCAT	 Companies seeking new share listings in Singapore may be advised to put off their initial public offerings (IPOs) after recent issues performed poorly, market analysts and underwriters said on the weekend. &quot;If the client really wants to go ahead with the IPO, the underwriter would suggest lowering the price so that the issue would be fully subscribed. Most likely some of the issues could be postponed,&quot; said Liew Yin Sze, chief economist at JM Sassoon in Singapore. In the last two weeks, three of the four IPOs -- Natsteel Broadway, a contract manufacturer of plastic and metal components for electronics products, clothing exporter Easyknit and seafood supplier Pacific Andes -- fell below their offer prices on their debut. Natsteel Broadway's and Easyknit's IPOs were also undersubscribed. On Friday, Easyknit closed at Hong Kong $2.775 (US$0.36), below its IPO price of HK$3.05, Pacific Andes at US$0.48 was below its offer price of US$0.57 and Natsteel Broadway was at US$0.665 compared to its offer price of US$0.70. &quot;Where possible, we will advise clients on a more favourable window. For primary listings, we may stretch things a bit,&quot; said an underwriter from a local bank. A local merchant banker said: &quot;If the market sentiment runs against you, it is fruitless to run against the tide. Retail investors who have lost money will not be inclined to come back so quickly unless they see an improvement in the trend. As an investment manager, our advice would be to delay the issue.&quot; Underwriters said some companies were reluctant to postpone IPOs as they might incur extra cost from having to submit a new set of audited accounts. Liew said he thought most companies would rather postpone issues if they thought they could get a better price later. &quot;I would want to float my company at the highest possible price. A price earnings (PE) of one to two points (higher) can mean a lot to total IPO proceeds,&quot; he said. Analysts said so far foreign-denominated issues had suffered badly while those denominated in Singapore dollars like engineering specialist Presscrete Holdings did well with a 20 percent-plus premium over its offer price of S$0.30 when it made its September 30 debut. Another recently listed local currency stock, SMB United, managed a small premium over its offer price even though its switchgear business was not considered too exciting by analysts. They said most retail investors in Singapore shunned foreign-currency denominated stocks for fear of currency risks and did not pay too much attention to fundamentals. &quot;In a bull run, they don't bother so much with the quality of an issue and make money because it's a bull run. In a bad market situation likewise they don't look at fundamentals again, which is wrong,&quot; said a local broking firm's research manager. T.K. Yap, director of institutional sales at Ong &amp; Co, said institutional demand for IPOs had also been weak as they had not jumped in to mop up shares that fell below their issue prices. The market would be watching two current IPOs, French pastry company Delifrance and Labroy Marine, both denominated in Singapore currency, to gauge whether investors were generally losing enthusiasm in IPOs. &quot;Delifrance would be a better reflection of the IPO demand because it is a name everyone is familiar with. And it would be interesting if a higher PE stock could get a better response than a lower PE stock,&quot; said Yap. Delifrance's offer closes on October 17 and shares are slated to start trading on October 21. (US$1=HKG$7.73) (US$1=S$1.41)
C22,C31,CCAT	 Toyota Motor Corp. believes American buyers will shun the sculpted styling of the Taurus in favour of the sharper edges on the redesigned 1997 Camry. But dethroning the Taurus as the best-selling car in the United States this year will be difficult because of a model changeover for the all-new Camry, Donald Esmond, vice president of Toyota's Avalon, Camry and Previa Vehicle Team, said Thursday. The Camry has been on a sales roll, and Toyota expects to sell 340,000 of the mid-size cars in all of 1996 -- the most of any single year since the car was introduced in 1983, Esmond said at a press event at the Toyota Technical Centre. Camry sales through August were up 8.6 percent from the first eight months of 1995. Toyota sold a total of 328,600 of the cars in all of 1995. &quot;Is it in the realm of possibility that Camry could be the No. 1 car? Yes, but we're not going to target that,&quot; Esmond said. &quot;We're not about to get into a shoot-out for the No. 1 car.&quot; Ford Motor Co., however, is not about to give up without a fight. On Thursday, Ford said it added $500 to the existing incentives on the 1996 Taurus, giving the car a $1,500 rebate through Oct. 1. Esmond said market research and consumer focus groups turned up buyers who do not want the distinctive, rounded styling featured on the 1996 Taurus. &quot;We feel they are moving away from the melted chocolate look,&quot; he said. So Toyota designers came up with a Camry the company says embodies an industry move to &quot;crisp&quot; styling. Toyota said it also sought to give the new Camry a more prestigious and sporty look. The front bumper and grille are integrated, and the hood starts lower before sweeping up to the front windscreen. At the same time, Toyota is trying to appeal to younger, more male buyers with the 1997 Camry, which represents the fourth generation of the car. Both the 2.2 litre four cylinder and 3.0 litre V6 engines in the cars have been upgraded to produce more horsepower. In calendar 1997 Toyota expects about 20 percent of its cars to be sold with V6 engine, up from 12 percent in 1996. Toyota expects the new Camry will reduce the median buyer's age to 43 or below from the current 45, and increase the percentage of males to 44 percent from 39 percent now. Massive cost-cutting and a more favourable yen-dollar exchange rate have allowed Toyota to bring prices down and position the car for more budget-conscious buyers. Sticker prices for the average 1997 model Camry are down $363 from the 1996 version. Toyota officials say they have been able to take costs out of the car without stripping it of items consumers want. The company was able to save about $20 per car, for instance, by replacing power antennas on the LE and XLE models with on-glass antennas mounted on the rear window. The base CE model has standard &quot;whip&quot; antenna. Toyota also added safety and comfort features. The Camry comes with a 30 percent larger glove box; new cupholders in the front and rear that can accommodate juice boxes; and an overhead compartment that can hold either sunglasses or a garage door opener.

M11,MCAT	 Brazilian shares ended higher Thursday but trade calmed from recent hectic sessions, with volume down sharply as a lack of news gave the market a chance to breathe, brokers said. &quot;Liquidity tightened a lot today. The market paused to reflect,&quot; said a dealer with local brokerage Sintese. The Sao Paulo bourse's Bovespa index  of 47 most-traded shares closed up 0.78 (corrects from 0.94) percent at 12,524 (corrects from 12,544) points, a rise of 97 (corrects from 117) points, on turnover totalling 765.5 (corrects from 759.8) million reais ($709 million).   For the past several weeks, daily trade has fluctuated between a billion reais and 1.4 billion reais as the market has swung wildly in highly volatile sessions. On Thursday, a lack of market-moving news gave fund managers and other investors a chance to reflect on the recent brusk brusk rises and falls. &quot;People are pausing to think,&quot; said a trader at local Schahin Cury brokerage. Despite the slackening trade, the bolsa followed rising U.S. shares higher.   The market's rise was led by telecom stocks, particularly equipment supplier Swedish-owned Ericsson Telecomunicacoes The bolsa's benchmark share, Telebras preferred, ended 0.77 percent higher at 157 reais, while its common share rose 0.65 percent to end at 140.89 points. Among other blue chips, mining giant Cia Vale do Rio Doce closed 4.55 percent higher at 30.10 reais and state oil firm Petrobras slipped 0.32 percent to end 315 reais. Brazilian power shares rose moderately, with the bolsa's Electrical Energy Index  closing up 0.41 percent at 3,426 points. Federal power holding Eletrobras, which had posted sharp rises in recent sessions after plunging last week, ended flat at 625 reais. Brokers said Friday's session, barring any major local or foreign news, should be a repeat of Thursday's calm session. ((--James Craig, Sao Paulo newsroom 5511 2485413))
M11,MCAT	 Shares pared gains after the HEX index hit a new intra-session 13-month peak of 2,272.21 as profit-taking bit into Nokia gains but metal stocks held firm, brokers said. The HEX ended up 0.55 percent at 2,265.47. Volume was fair at 359 million markka, 50 percent of it in Nokia. Trade in Nokia, which is due to report nine-month interim results on Thursday, was lively but cautiousness, while edginess ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting on Wednesday restrained activity in most stocks, brokers said. &quot;Players are watching the Fed though no rate hike is expected,&quot; one broker said. Nokia closed 2.00 markka lower at 230.00 after touching a new calendar year high 234.50 markka. Engineering group Tampella ended fair trade at a 13-month high 11.80 markka, up 0.90, boosted by improved earnings prospects and technical factors, after the share passed its previous 10.90 markka year-high last week, brokers said. Cranes maker Konecranes closed at a new life-high 145.00 markka, up 10.00, following Monday's news of its acquisition of a German crane builder. Forestries corrected upwards in quiet trade after recent sharp losses. Swedish AssiDoman's nine-month report did not affect Finnish forestry stocks as the figures were in line with expectations, brokers said. UPM-Kymmene rose 1.00 markka to 88.00, while Enso closed flat at 34.00 markka. Food and feed group Cultor's 2 series closed fair trade 5.00 markka up at 209.00 after the company announced the sale of its itaconic acid business for more than 200 million markka.
M13,M132,MCAT	 The dollar is expected to be weak against the yen during Asian trade on Wednesday, with the market focusing on the release of Japan's May customs-cleared trade data due out at 2350 GMT, dealers said. Stronger-than-expected figures are likely to push the dollar down against the yen, but the market is eager to see whether the greenback will receive some support from talk of bids from life insurers and pension funds near 112.80 yen. But a trust bank dealer said the dollar could fall further towards 112 yen if it clearly breaks below that point and sets off possible stop-loss sales.   &quot;If the data shows strong figures, it will be a yen-buying factor,&quot; the trust bank dealer said. &quot;Even if the figures are within market expectations, the dollar will remain weak as a rising trend in Japan's trade surplus will be confirmed,&quot; a city bank dealer said. Economists expect Japan's surplus, on average, to rise to 548.5 billion yen in May, from 229 billion a year earlier. Forecasts ranged from 400 billion yen to 760 billion yen. The trust bank dealer said: &quot;The market will be keen to see whether bids from life insurers and pension funds via trust banks will actually appear near 112.80 to support the dollar.&quot;   He added that some life insurers and overseas operators have been buying dollar put options as they think there is a downside risk in dollar/yen trade. On the topside, exporter offers near 113.70 yen and above are expected to keep weighing on the dollar, dealers said. The city bank dealer said speculation of a possible rise in interest rates has somewhat receded in the United States for a while and that is another yen-supportive factor. In New York, U.S. reports showed on Tuesday that the economy continued to grow at a healthy clip in May.   The May Consumer Price Index showed a tame 0.1 percent rise, while the core rate rose 0.2 percent. The market was looking for a 0.2 percent rise in both. Other data showed a 4.8 percent fall in housing starts and a somewhat robust 0.4 percent rise in industrial output in May. Dollar/mark trade is likely to be directionless, possibly dominated by moves by dollar/yen and mark/yen, dealers said. But the trust bank dealer said bids are expected to emerge near 1.7250 marks to support the greenback.

C11,C21,CCAT	 International fund manager David Herro, who runs the $1.6 billion Oakmark International Fund and the Oakmark International Small Cap, said his investment team looked for foreign companies rather than markets which would outperform, Barron's said. But even when using a set of stock selection criteria, certain geographical biases appeared, the investor weekly newspaper said in its May 26 edition. Herro said he continued to have a light weighting in Japan and did not have a strongly bullish outlook on the market, Barron's reported.   &quot;The point about Japan is that I believe it is out of sync in terms of value to us as owners of business,&quot; Herro was quoted as saying. Herro looked for companies selling at a cheap price relative to cash flow and for management whose aim was to build shareholder value, Barron's said. Sweden merited a higher weighting, he said. &quot;In that country, you have a number of high-quality multinational companies that are extremely well-run and, for the most part, run with shareholder interest in mind,&quot; he said, pointing to AB Volvo as an example. Right now, Herro was focused on Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Sweden, Barron's said. Leading his list of favorites is Malaysian cellular phone company Technology Resources Industries Bhd. In Britain, he liked Cordiant plc, Sedwick Group and sugar refiner Tate and Lyle, Barron's said. His investment team eliminated countries deemed unsafe or which lacked proper investor regulations, like Russia. They avoided direct investment in Chinese companies, Barron's said.

GCAT,GPOL,GVOTE	 Zambia holds presidential and parliamentary elections on Monday in which, after a boycott by the main opposition, the most significant count will be the number who turn out to vote at all. President Frederick Chiluba, 53, is on course to win the elections which, though meant to cement democracy in a model African state, have instead underlined its vulnerability. He faces four challengers for the presidency, but his only real rival is a man who is not even standing -- his veteran predecessor, Kenneth Kaunda, a founding father of African independence from colonialism who fell from grace. Kaunda, now main opposition leader, and smaller parties who backed his call for a poll boycott accuse Chiluba of breaking the pledge of democracy which won him power in 1991 after nearly three decades of Kaunda's socialist-oriented rule. They say he has changed the constitution, intimidated the media and rigged the registration of voters to cling to power. &quot;Go and tend your gardens on Monday and don't come back till dark,&quot; Kaunda urged supporters at his final anti-election rally. Polls are open from 6 a.m. till 6 p.m. (0400 till 1600 GMT) but full results are not expected until Wednesday. Foreign donors have frozen desperately needed aid to the poor southern African country, saying a law adopted in May to rule out candidates whose parents were not born in Zambia was clearly aimed at 72-year-old Kaunda, of Malawian descent. A defiant Chiluba told a weekend rally the poll would be valid whatever the turnout. &quot;Those who boycotted and have realised they have boobed will wait until 2001,&quot; he said. Though rioting marred the run-up to voting, many analysts have predicted apathy and pessimism afterwards rather than civil unrest in copper-rich but debt-ridden Zambia. The aid freeze, if kept up, may hurt servicing of Zambia's $6.4 billion debt. It would bring new hardship for people already reeling from austerity measures and job cuts as Chiluba pursues free-market policies and privatisation. Kaunda's United National Independnece Party (UNIP) has reformed, but would be unlikely to pursue privatisation as vigorously as Chiluba. On other issues they differ little. Political analysts said Chiluba seemed assured of victory and would have beaten Kaunda and remained the darling of the West even if he had let Kaunda stand They say his manoeuvring may dent support for his Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD). Only half the 4.6 million eligible voters have been registered - another source of opposition complaint -- and only half of these have received their voting cards. Kaunda urged people to hand in their cards to UNIP, but police say this is illegal and a have arrested some party officials. Hoping for dismally low turnout, Kaunda, who led Zambia to independence from Britain in 1964 and ran a one-party state until 1991, plans to demand fresh elections, but has little hope of success, diplomats said.

C13,C18,C181,C34,CCAT	 The British government said on Friday it  intended to refer the planned acquisition of Goldsborough Healthcare  Plc by the British United Provident Association Ltd to the Monopolies  and Mergers Commission (MMC) unless suitable undertakings were obtained  from BUPA.   The Competition and Consumer Affairs Minister, Nigel Griffiths, said  he had asked the Director General of Fair Trading (DGFT) to seek an  undertaking from BUPA to divest the shareholding in Independent British  Healthcare (IBH), which it will acquire if the proposed purchase of  Goldsborough proceeds. Goldsborough has a shareholding of just under 21 percent in IBH, which  operates 11 private hospitals as well as a number of nursing homes  and home care services in the UK. &quot;I believe that this shareholding would be sufficient to give BUPA  material influence over IBH,&quot; said Griffiths. &quot;I agree with the DGFT that the proposed mergers give rise to competition  concerns in relation to the market for private hospital beds, but  that these concers might be addressed by an undertaking from BUPA  to divest, and not in the future to re-acquire, any interest in IBH,&quot;  added the minister in a statement.

C18,C181,CCAT	 The vice-president of private Brazilian retail bank Banco Itau said the acquisition of Rio de Janeiro state bank Banerj would help to solidify and expand Itau's presence in Rio de Janeiro. Itau, Brazil's second largest private bank, bought Banerj Thursday for 311.1 million reais, slightly above the minimum price of 310 million reais, in a closed-envelope auction Thursday on the Rio de Janeiro stock exchange.   &quot;With the acquisition of Banerj we envisaged developing and solidifying our presence in Rio,&quot; said Itau Vice-President Olavo Franco Bueno Jr. &quot;Banerj brings us new retail clients which fits in with Itau's vocation as a retail bank. Banerj fits in well with Itau's strategy.&quot; Banco Itau has around 2,000 agencies across Brazil, 650 of which are located in Rio de Janeiro state. Banerj has 193 branch offices in Rio de Janeiro state. Bueno said Itau had not yet worked out a detailed action plan for Banerj and it was to early to say whether jobs would be cut and branches closed down.   But, he said Itau was interested in discussing with Rio's state government the possibility of continuing the services Banerj offered the state in the past. Itau, which has to pay for Banerj by July 9, will pay 100 percent of the auction price in privatization bonds. Banerj will continue to operate under the same name for the next two years, Bueno said.

The ruling was given by a WTO disputes panel last week. European Commission officials said that the EU's external trade and agriculture commissioners, Sir Leon Brittan and Franz Fischler, outlined this possibility at a weekly meeting of the EU's executive Commission in Strasbourg, France. &quot;There's the possibility of appealing. We will assess the best course of action,&quot; an official said, adding that a first step could be a request on June 4 for an interim review of the ruling. The official regretted that the WTO disputes panel had disregarded the EU's substanital supporting evidence. Another official said that the Commission, which has declined to give a formal reaction while it studied the confidential report, would respect WTO rules. &quot;The EU has always maintained the importance of the disputes settlement procedure and will continue to do so,&quot; the official said.

GCAT,GDIP,GPOL	 Nobel peace prize laureate Jose Ramos-Horta on Tuesday dismissed as &quot;silly&quot; a Philippine ban on him entering the country during the upcoming APEC summit, saying it would only draw media attention to East Timor. &quot;I am always amazed that an individual like me, without an army and navy behind me, can be considered a potential disturbance,&quot; Ramos-Horta told Reuters from his Sydney home. &quot;I have no intention of going to the Philippines to create disturbance. My idea was to engage in public forums to discuss a peace process (for East Timor), with possible Philippines mediation,&quot; he said. The Philippines' top security official confirmed on Monday that Ramos-Horta had been banned from entering the country, saying his presence would be an &quot;embarrassment&quot;. Presidential national security adviser Jose Almonte said Ramos-Horta was in the category of foreigners who &quot;may cause disturbance&quot; during the November 25 summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in nearby Subic freeport. &quot;Our assessment is it (Ramos-Horta's presence) will cause embarrassment to the nation,&quot; Almonte told reporters. Ramos-Horta, a spokesman for the East Timor resistance movement, and East Timor Catholic bishop Carlos Belo were named joint winners of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize 10 days ago. Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony of East Timor in 1975, just after Portugal pulled out, and annexed the territory the following year. The United Nations does not recognise Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor. President Fidel Ramos said last weekend he had ordered the immigration bureau to bar the entry of anyone who might disrupt the summit meeting, but Ramos did not specifically mention the East Timorese resistance leader. A parliamentary spokesman has said Ramos-Horta's ban was out of respect to Indonesian President Suharto who is expected to attend the APEC summit. Ramos-Horta said he had planned to attend a non-governmental organisations conference in Manila from November 21-24 and not visit the APEC venue at Subic Bay. &quot;They are silly raising all this media attention on me, causing all this fuss,&quot; he said. &quot;The media would not have cared about me and my conference. We would have been lucky to get one journalist.&quot; Manila barred Ramos-Horta and other East Timorese dissidents from entering the country in 1994 during an international human rights conference on East Timor. &quot;Two years ago...Indonesia bullied the Philippines into trying to cancel the conference. As a result hundreds of media articles appeared on East Timor,&quot; Ramos-Horta said. &quot;It was a major public relations fiasco.&quot;

E51,E512,ECAT	 New Zealand's merchandise trade went into the black in December for the first time in six months, Statistics New Zealand said on Tuesday. It posted a NZ$10.4 million surplus in December against an $80.0 million deficit in November (revised from $91.95 million) to give an annual deficit of $368.5 million. December marks the beginning of New Zealand's export season. SNZ said the trend in the merchandise trade balance has been improving since a low point in February 1996. From February to December, the exports trend estimate averaged a rise of 0.4 percent while the imports trend averaged a fall of 0.5 percent.   In recent months the exports trend has shown a small deterioration but the imports trend is declining at a faster rate. December exports at $1.71 billion were up 0.9 percent on December 1995 while imports at $1.70 billion were down 0.2 percent. For the December quarter, exports were up 2.6 percent on the year ago quarter and imports fell by 3.0 percent. The trade deficit in the quarter at $234 million was a $298 million improvement on the December 1995 quarter.   Over the year, exports were up 0.5 percent at $21.04 billion and imports rose by 0.7 percent to $21.40 billion. -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746

M12,M13,M132,MCAT	 South African bonds notched up solid gains on Tuesday after May reserves data caught most market players by surprise and spurred jobbers to buy yields almost 20 points lower on the day. At 1420 GMT, the benchmark R150 was pegged at 14.705 percent from 14.85 percent late on Monday after touching an intraday low of 14.66 percent. Dealers said the market's main focus on the day was the Reserve Bank announcement on Monday night that gross gold and foreign exchange reserves leapt 7.4 billion rand to 21.8 billion rand in May. &quot;The guys were expecting a figure of about 16 billion and even economists who took flyers were calling for around 20 billion. To get a figure of 21.8 billion rand took everyone by surprise so the bond market firmed,&quot; a trader said. Dealers noted though that trade on the day had generally been thin and that the main interest came from jobbers. After running into technical resistance at 14.66 percent, dealers said jobbers had taken some profits as the market consolidated its gains. Institutions, despite being more optimistic after the reserves number, remained cautious and held largely to the sidelines. &quot;With July 1 coming up...the bigger players are a bit hesitant about coming into this market,&quot; a trader said. Finance Minister Trevor Manuel announced in his March 12 budget that individuls will be allowed to invest offshore or hold foreign currency bank accounts for the first time from July 1, a step which some players expect to lead to a hefty exodus of capital from the country. &quot;We need to see July 1 and, until then, the bigger players will remain sceptical so that if anything does go wrong they won't be caught on the wrong side,&quot; the trader said. On Wednesday, traders said more of the same was expected, with a possible test of 14.75 percent on the upside possible and 14.66 percent appearing to represent the bottom of the market's downside potential for now.

E12,ECAT,G15,G151,G154,GCAT,GPOL	 None of Sweden's 22 government ministers is firmly committed to joining Europe's Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), a Swedish newspaper said on Tuesday. After asking all cabinet members about their stance on EMU, Dagens Nyheter said no minister openly supported membership from the union's planned start on January 1, 1999. It said 14 members had not made up their minds and even the four that expressed a positive view on membership said they had not made a final decision. Agriculture Minister Annika Ahnberg has been the only minister to say earlier she was for Sweden's early entry, but her spokesman said this week that she was now undecided and was waiting for a debate on the issue. Four other ministers indicated to the paper that they were opposed to Sweden's entering EMU from the start. In September this year the ruling Social Democrats will consider the EMU question at its annual congress. But in June the party leadership is expected to make its position on the issue clear after remaining uncommitted so far. -- Belinda Goldsmith, Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700 1017

C13,C17,C174,CCAT	 Deutsche Bank's rare and treasured triple-A credit rating came under the spotlight on Monday as Moody's Investors Service said it was looking at implications of the situation regarding Morgan Grenfell Asset Management. &quot;I can tell you we are looking at the situation,&quot; Samuel Theodore, managing director for European financial institutions at Moody's in London, told Reuters. Apart from Deutsche, Union Bank of Switzerland and Rabobank of the Netherlands are the only other banks to enjoy triple-A ratings without any kind of sovereign guarantee. Meanwhile, investment bank Salomon Brothers said the worry that Deutsche Bank might return to its accident-prone image of the early 1990s may be the most serious concern stemming from problems at the bank's asset management arm. In a research note, European banking analyst Matthew Czepliewicz said the reversion came at an awkward time for the German banking giant. Recently, Deutsche had to inject 550 million marks ($369 million) into the rescue of troubled engine-maker Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG and its much-prized triple-A credit rating is seen as vulnerable in certain quarters. Czepliewicz said Deutsche is likely to be especially sensitive to talk of losing its credit rating. In Frankfurt, Deutsche Bank bank spokesman Detlev Rahmsdorf declined comment on any danger to Deutsche's triple A rating. &quot;This is something for Moody's and S&amp;P to decide, not us,&quot; he said. Czepliewicz said that the reasons why Deutsche's rating has come under scrutiny recently have been the bank's greater emphasis on global investment banking and intensifying competition in the domestic banking market. Last week, Deutsche's Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGMA) was forced to temporarily suspend three of its funds and an urgent investigation into possible &quot;irregularities&quot; was launched in conjunction with regulatory authorities. Deutsche has already injected 180 million pounds by buying some unlisted stocks out of the fund which were subject to suspect valuations but could face further claims from investors and possible regulatory fines. Other major embarrassments for Deutsche in the 1990s have included the near collapse of metals and mining group Mettallgesellschaft AG and the fall of the Juergen Schneider property empire. In the latter case, Deutsche chief executive Hilmar Kopper infamously described the losses sustained by Schneider's creditors as &quot;peanuts&quot;. Assuming a 50 percent loss on the 180 million pounds injected into the MGAM situation so far, Czepliewicz says 1996 earnings growth for the bank is likely to be 11 percent rather than the 15 percent previously forecast. &quot;Any serious setback to the global markets in the second half would cut this growth to single digits,&quot; he says. Czepliewicz says the sustained loss of fund management earnings in the long term is likely to be slight and says the embarrassment of the MGAM case must be seen in the context of comparatively strong earnings growth, better than expected cost control and a welcome board restructuring. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 8864.

The 30-share IBIS DAX index was up 6.79 points at 2,697.58 at 0831 GMT while December DTB DAX futures were up five at 2,705.5 points.

Other early gainers included chemical group BASF AG on news of a joint venture with Dutch chemicals group DSM. BASF was up 55 pfennigs at 48.10 marks. Fellow chemical group Henkel KGaA was up 1.70 marks at 70 marks on unusually high volumes after announcing it planned a full takeover of U.S. adhesive firm Loctite Corp.

C13,CCAT,GCAT,GDIP,GPRO	 Media mogul Ted Turner blasted the United States government on Friday for vetoing the re-election of U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, attacked business rival Rupert Murdoch and said Britain always does what the United States asks it to do. And that was just in the first few minutes of a speech to a forum of television executives from five continents at the United Nations on the global impact of television. With Boutros-Ghali seated nearby, Turner asked, &quot;Who is the United States to stand alone against the re-election of this good man here?&quot; Saying he loved the United Nations, he also called on the United States to pay its $1.4 billion debt to the world body. Amid applause and shouts of &quot;bravo,&quot; Turner said, &quot;I just ask that the United States reverse its position and go along ... We believe in democracy. That means the majority rules and the majority voted 14 to one,&quot; he said, referring to a vote in the Security Council on Tuesday to re-elect Boutros-Ghali. &quot;Even England voted to re-elect this man and England always does what the United States asks them to do.&quot; Turner said he thought about buying the U.S. debt from the United Nations &quot;and giving my IOU to the U.S. government.&quot; But &quot;I thought it would be a grandstand play and I would be criticised for doing it. So pay up. You owe the money, you pay it.&quot; Declaring himself a strong believer in local control of television, he said: &quot;We were very benign. Now, already you can see that there is a new group coming, led by that no-good SOB (son of a bitch) Rupert Murdoch. &quot;They want to control the world. They want to control the television world. We have got to do everything we can to stop them.&quot; Again excoriating his Australian-born rival, Turner said: &quot;Rupert Murdoch, sitting wherever he is -- I don't know what country he is supposedly from, he is truly a citizen of the world -- he wants to sit here and control Indian television in India, he wants to control Chinese television in China. Bullshit! I don't know how that translates into other languages.&quot; Turner, who founded Cable News Network (CNN), is now vice-chairman of Time Warner media conglomerate, which has refused to broadcast Murdoch's Fox News Channel, a competitor of CNN in New York, the biggest cable market. Asked later by a participant in the forum how peace could be made between himself and Murdoch, Turner replied: &quot;That is a battle between good and evil. I don't want to talk about that no-good bastard anymore.&quot;
C11,C13,CCAT,E12,ECAT,M13,M132,MCAT	 Major banks from Japan, the United States and Europe plan to team up to form a new financial institution capable of real-time currency settlements, bank officials said on Tuesday. The new institution would handle settlements for currency trade in eight core currencies in real-time, hoping in this way to reduce settlement risk, they said. Currently, banks are exposed to large amounts of cross-border currency settlement risks because delivery of foreign exchange transactions is made in different time zones.   There is also a risk in foreign currency settlements that after one bank has delivered one side of the transaction, its counterparty may go bankrupt and fail to deliver the offsetting currency. The new bank, scheduled to be established in 1999, would allow payments of both sides of the transactions, say in both dollars and yen, at the same time, the sources said. To minimise the impact of potential business failures among international financial institutions, the member banks would be authorised to issue collateral in return for a leadership role in currency settlement business, they added.   But central banks would reserve the right to intervene directly in serious cases of financial failure, they said. Twenty banks are currently likely to take part, including Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and Fuji Bank of Japan, Citibank and J.P. Morgan of the United States, and Britain's National Westminster Bank. The currencies handled are likely to include the U.S. dollar, the Canadian dollar, the yen, the mark, the pound, the French franc, the Swiss franc and the Dutch guilder, the sources said. A number of details remain to be worked out, including the location of the new bank and how many banks will ultimately take part. The new institution's stance towards to a single European currency, to debut in 1999, also remains to be decided, the sources said. --Tokyo Treasury Desk +813-3432-8806
M11,MCAT	 Shares eased marginally in calm trading marked by the decline of the banking sector and Ericsson, offset by real estate gains. &quot;There's not much going on, no news. A few real estate shares are being bought, banks are being sold a bit but it's all in reaction to yesterday,&quot; said one broker. Yesterday's big gainer was the banking index, which eased today by 1.55 percent. &quot;Now that the smoke has cleared after the banking rally you can see that some of the shares are really at a high level,&quot; said another broker.   But another sector governed by interest-rate factors, building and property, rose 0.8 percent. Skanska put on four to 300 crowns after touching a record 303. NCC rose one to 92.50 after announcing nine-month results. Ericsson contributed to the general downturn, its B-share seizing the lion's share of volume with 200 million crowns while easing three to 197. Sands Petroleum, one of yesterday's gainers on positive newspaper reports, advanced 1.30 further in lively trade to 44 crowns. -- Joel Dahlberg, Stockholm Newsroom 08-700 1011
GCAT,GDIS,GENV	 Heavy rain for the last four days has wreaked havoc throughout Austria, triggering floods and mudslides and crippling road and rail traffic, Austrian state television said on Tuesday. The situation was most serious in the east of the Alpine republic around Vienna where hundreds of people in the flood plains needed to be evacuated. Some areas, with water levels already touching the roofs of houses, were completely cut off. One person has drowned and another is missing, television said.
C17,CCAT,M13,M131,MCAT	 The Bank of Korea plans to supply one trillion won to commercial banks on Friday through repurchase agreements as there are fears that Hanbo Steel Corp's default on debt payments could affect the liquidity situation, an official at the central bank said.   &quot;Although there is no problem with the liquidity situation at the moment, the bank decided to supply the money to minimise fears resulting from Hanbo's default,&quot; the official said. He said the fund supply was also aimed at preventing a possible liquidity squeeze next week when about 3.7 trillion won worth of value added taxes are due to be paid. The repurchase agreements will mature on February 10. Hanbo defaulted on an unspecified amount of loans on Thursday. Creditor banks have said they will seek court receivership and a new owner for the ailing steel maker. -- Seoul Newsroom (822) 727-5646
C11,C18,C181,CCAT	 The newly appointed chief executive officer of Meredith Corp said Monday that the company was beginning to see prices for television stations peak and come down. That could lead to Meredith making an acqusiiton sometime in 1997, said William Kerr, who is currently president and chief operating officer of the media company. &quot;We are hopeful that certainly in the course of the next calendar year that we would see some action,&quot; said Kerr, who will become chief executive January 1.   In the next few years, Meredith, which owns seven television stations could acquire about five more, he said in an interview. &quot;I think it may be easier in calendar 1997 than in calendar 1996 to make an attractive acquisition,&quot; he said, describing attractive as a VHF network affiliate in the 10th to 40th largest U.S. markets. &quot;We'd like a larger market, but we think it's unlikely one will become available,&quot; he said. The Des Moines, Iowa-based company also publishes magazines including Better Homes and Gardens and Ladies' Home Journal.   He said Meredith will not seek publishing acqusitions, he said. Instead, the company plans to launch new titles, including Family Money magazine, which is expected to be launched in the first half of 1997. Due to consolidation in the magazine business in the 1980s and early 1990s, &quot;we do not think there are many acquisitions&quot; to be made on the publishing side, he said. Kerr said he did not see another major magazine launch by the time the company's fiscal year ends next June, but said one could be launched later in the calendar year.   He would not say what the next title would be, but said it would be compatable with the publisher's family focus. Publishing currently makes up about 54 percent of Merideth's earnings, broadcasting about 43 percent, with the rest coming from licensing, Kerr said. The company currently has two licensing agreements with Wal-Mart Stores Inc, and Kerr said other agreements are possible, both with Wal-Mart and other companies. But he also said a new deal is not likely to happen for 12 to 18 months. &quot;I think it is unlikely that we would have a major new deal to announce in this fiscal year,&quot; Kerr said. On Monday, Meredith said its board of directors appointed Kerr chief exectuive officer. He had been president and chief operating officer. Kerr, 55, will replace Jack Rehm January 1, though Rehm will remain chairman until December 31, 1997, when he plans to retire, Kerr said. --Reuters Chicago newsdesk, 312-408-8787

M11,MCAT	 Speculators beware! The Chinese Year of the Bull may live up to its name as far as the Hong Kong stock market goes, but other markets may behave more like mad cows. That's the word according to the readings of Chinese geomancers or Feng Shui masters in Hong Kong tapped by Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia (CLSA) for its eagerly awaited 1997 Feng Shui report. The index had humble beginnings as a Chinese New Year card for CLSA clients in the Year of the Monkey in 1992. Embarrassingly for many a well-paid stocks analyst who called the market wrong that year, the Feng Shui experts correctly anticipated all seven major turning points in Hong Kong's blue chip indicator, the Hang Seng index. The rest, as they say, is history. &quot;We would not, of course, recommend any investor take the CLSA Feng Shiu Index with anything more than the moo which it was intended,&quot; the firm warned sternly, with one eye firmly to the less-than-ghostly world of securities regulators. &quot;Especially those large prudent institutions responsible for running funds on behalf of the bereaved and parentless.&quot; But for the curious -- and the desperate -- here's what the Year of the Bull -- the second animal in the 12-animal Chinese calendar -- has in store, according to the geomancers. The 4,000-year-old practice of Feng Shui, literally wind and water, gauges the harmony or lack of it between the five traditional elements -- metal, water, fire, wood and earth. In the Year of the Bull, there will be a confluence of opposing elements, water and fire, suggesting a volatile time ahead, particularly going into the third quarter -- although peace and harmony will prevail by the end of the year, the CLSA report concludes. &quot;Long term investors will do well in the Year of the Bull, but traders or speculators may get gored as world markets charge around like a herd of mad cows.&quot; Tigers, Rabbits, Horse and Dragons will have the best fortune while Dogs, Roosters, Goats, Snakes and Bulls should avoid the market altogether. If they really must invest, they should focus only on blue chips for the long-term. As for the British colony of Hong Kong, where the Year of the Bull ushers in the most momentous change in more than 150 years -- the handover to China in mid-1997 -- the outlook for the market is quite bright. As for the handover itself, the CLSA Feng Shui index confidently predicts a smooth transition at midnight on June 30 -- with one exception. That exception is Hong Kong's future leader, former shipping magnate turned Hong Kong Chief Executive-designate, Tung Chee-hwa. &quot;Coming from the comparative freedom of running one of the world's largest shipping companies, recently-elected CEO Tung will not enjoy 1997, with the world's scrutiny suddenly falling upon his shoulders,&quot; the Feng Shui experts predicted. And Tung's sign? He was born in 1937, which makes him a Bull.

C24,C33,CCAT	 Barrick Gold Corp said on Wednesday it did not breach a confidentiality agreement with Bre-X Minerals Ltd. Bre-X said earlier Wednesdsay that Barrick had broken an agreement by publicly releasing details of a proposed joint venture between the two companies to develop the Busang gold deposit in Indonesia. But Barrick spokesman Vince Borg said the details had all been made public previously by Indonesian government officials. &quot;Did the government not issue a letter advising Reuters and others of the split?&quot; he asked rhetorically. &quot;I can show you clippings with the minister and Umar Said explicitly talking about the ownership split.&quot; Bre-X complained that Barrick publicized that Busang would be split with 67.5 percent for Barrick and its partners, 22.5 percent for Bre-X and its partners and 10 percent for the government. Barrick also said a contract of work to develop Busang would go to the new joint venture company, not Bre-X. ((Heather Scoffield, Reuters Toronto Bureau 416 941-8104))
M11,MCAT	 China's B share indices in Shanghai and Shenzhen fell sharply on Monday due to poor sentiment, and further drops are expected in the short term, brokers said. Shanghai's B index tumbled 4.52 percent to 61.781 points, on turnover of $6.2 million against $6.6 million last Friday, while Shenzhen's B index fell 4.02 percent to close at 136.46 on turnover of HK$89 million against HK$161 million. On the Shanghai B share market, heavy profit-taking in property developer Lujiazui after the listing of its four-for-10 bonus issue shares worsened market sentiment and pushed the index down, brokers said. Market barometer Lujiazui was the most active share, falling 7.89 percent to $0.840 on volume of 3.1 million shares. &quot;There is no sign that Lujiazui will stop falling in the short term and most investors have no interest in building positions,&quot; one Shanghai-based broker said. On the Shenzhen B share market, the index closed sharply lower on poor sentiment influenced by rumours on the health of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, brokers said. &quot;There have been many rumours in the market that Deng was in poor health,&quot; a Shenzhen broker said. Shenzhen brokers said the declines were also due to expectations among investors that many of China's listed firms were unlikely to report a significant rise in earnings for 1996 despite two interest rate cuts in the past year. &quot;The downward trend could extend into the next few sessions unless there is some good news,&quot; a second Shenzhen broker said. Changan Automobile was the most active stock on volume of 2.95 million shares and slipped HK$0.18 to HK$4.27. The Shanghai A share market also fell sharply on weaker market sentiment, and is expected to drop further in the short term, brokers said. The A index closed down 2.51 percent to 913.841 points on turnover of 1.8 billion yuan. Dongfang Boiler was the biggest loser on profit-taking, tumbling 9.35 percent to 9.40 yuan. On the Shenzhen A share market, the index dived 6.22 percent to end at 319.25 on turnover of 3.78 billion yuan compared with Friday's 5.92 billion yuan, with selling focused on cheap-priced stocks, brokers said. Hainan Pearl River slid 0.62 yuan to end at limit-down of 5.54 yuan due to pessimism over the property developer's 1996 results, brokers said.

C18,C183,CCAT	 The third tranche sale of Italian energy giant Eni's shares could be raised to meet heavy demand for the offer, the director general of one of the global cordinators for the placement said on Friday. &quot;The market is in a position to accept a wider offer, but this decision lies with the (Italian) Treasury because there is a limit that needs respecting,&quot; said Rainer Masera of Italian investment bank Imi. The Treasury, which currently owns some 69 percent of Eni, has placed a 14.4-percent stake in the energy group on the market, making it the biggest international share offer this year. But Treasury director general Mario Draghi indicated earlier this month that if demand was sufficient, the government would place a further 3.6-percent stake on the market, dropping its overall holding to 51 percent. Eni has consistently posted improving reselts over recent years, chalking up a record group net profit of 4.45 trillion lire in 1996 and promising further profit growth for 1997. The sale closes later on Friday, and the Treasury is due to announce details of the placement at the weekend. Masera told reporters in the central Italian town of Foligno the sale of some 400 million Eni shares reserved for small Italian investors was particularly strongly. The government hopes to raise at least 10 trillion lire ($5.9 billion) from the Eni sale and said last week the maximum price for the offer would be 9,325 lire. Shares of the multinational operation headed by Franco Bernabei were down 103 lire at 9,545 lire by 1240 GMT on Friday. The Eni sell-off has been a high-point in Italy's otherwise sluggish privatisation programme, with political in-fighting regularly delaying many other sales. Italy launched the first tranche Eni privatisation in November 1995, placing 15 percent of the company on the market at a price of 5,250 lire per share. In October 1996, a further 16 percent was sold at 6,910 lire per share. $1 = 1,694 lire
M14,M142,MCAT	 Volatilities of over-the-counter gold options soared over the past few days, with one-month levels reaching 10 percent as spot gold dived, dealers said. &quot;Last Friday vols hammered up during the last few hours of Comex trading and yesterday things were also very volatile in early Europe, vols were exploding,&quot;one dealer in Europe said. Implied volatilities for one-month options were bid as high as 10 percent on Monday, up from 6.1 percent at the end of last year, he said. But on Tuesday, one-month volatilities pulled back to about 8.75 percent, dealers said. &quot;Even though there's still some activity, it doesn't warrant those high rates,&quot; a dealer in London said. Another said despite any short-term easing, volatilities should generally hold their firmer stance in coming weeks. For some dealers, most of the activity in recent days was in strikes close to the money, with trading seen in both puts and calls. One dealer said the delta ranged from 33 percent to 40 percent, with the widest strikes about $1.50 from spot levels. The interest has been focused on short-term dates, from one to three months, they added. Another dealer, however, said he had seen business in strikes from $350 to $370. &quot;But I think people have very little on their books below $350 and not much below $360. Today we did see some interest in $350s,&quot; he said. Volatilities in longer dates also were firmer, but not to the same extent as one month material. Three months implied volatilties were bid at 7.5 to 8.25 percent, six months at 7.3 to 7.5 percent and one-year at 7.0 to 7.2 percent. --Eric Onstad, London Newsroom +44 171 542 8065
E12,ECAT	 President Jose Maria Figueres of Costa Rica said the country is enlisting leading U.S. academics to forge new development strategies. Speaking at a Latin American investment conference, Figueres said gone were the days when Costa Rica attracted generous foreign aids because it was a model of &quot;peace and democracy&quot; in the region. A &quot;change of paradigm&quot; is needed for Costa Rica to compete in the post-Cold War era, he said. Costa Rica has spearheaded alliance with its Central American neighbors and has worked with U.S. economists such as Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University to devise new blueprints for development, Figures said. With a per capita income of $2,600, which is far above the average in Central American countries, Costa Rica does not have the advantage of low-cost labor.  Instead it must rely on higher productivity to produce value-added export, he said. Figueres expected the export to exceed $5 billion in 1998. The successful ecotourism is attracting 700,000 tourists a year to Costa Rica's extensive parks and natural reserves, which cover 24 percent of the country, he said. Now in joint ventures with a U.S. pharmaceutical company and a European group, the country is in the forefront of exploring commercial uses of biodiversity, Figureres said. &quot;Conservation of the environment makes good business sense,&quot; he said. --N.A.

C15,C152,C18,C182,CCAT	 Georgia-Pacific Corp. said Thursday it agreed to sell timber assets in central California to Sierra Pacific for about $320 million. Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific, the nation's second largest forest products company, said it will post a gain of $80 million on the sale of the operation based in Martell, Calif., about 50 miles southeast of Sacramento. The assets being sold include 127,000 acres of timberland, a sawmill and a particle-board plant. The company's Georgia-Pacific West Inc. unit bought the operation in 1988 for an undisclosed price. The site produces Western soft lumber and other products. Spokesman Ken Haldin said the sale was not connected with Georgia-Pacific's efforts to reduce costs and improve efficiency. &quot;This is just one sale, unto itself,&quot; he said. &quot;The offer was significant enough that we believed it was in our best interests and in our shareholders' best interests to proceed with the sale.&quot; Georgia-Pacific stock rose 75 cents to close at $71.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.
M14,M141,MCAT	 LIFFE robusta coffee futures charged sharply higher in late Thursday trading, lifting benchmark July to a new one-year high of $1,940 a tonne on renewed fund buying. Fund stop-loss buying was triggered as prices crossed the $1,900 mark, traders said. By the close, July stood at $1,933, still a sharp $63 gain on the day.   After hovering at around $1,880 in the morning, July vaulted above the pyschological $1,900 level in late afternoon before clearing a chart resistance at $1,930. It rose futher but failed to pierce the $1,940 mark. The next layer of resistance is pegged at $1,950. Robustas prices were at the highest levels since May last year when the market surged ahead of Brazilian frost scares. There were no crop-damaging frost last year or in 1995. Two severe frosts, one in June and another in 1994 destroyed Brazilian cherries. A drought that followed took London prices to 10-year highs of $4,140 in September 1994. Prices then took a tumble to hit a two-year low of $1,203 in January this year. Then as supply concern reignited in Latin America, the current new rally gathered momentum to take the market back up. Robusta prices alone had risen by 61 percent so far this year. Brazil's frost season is fast approaching and with the current tight supply situation of good quality coffee, the market can ill afford another blow to supply. Volume in London reached 7,873 lots, centered in July contract. -- Jalil Hamid, London newsroom +44 171 542 4985

M13,M132,MCAT	 The dollar rose against most currencies on Wednesday after the Commerce Department announced the U.S. international trade deficit shrank a surprisingly large 19.3 percent in March, dealers said. Also, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin gave the dollar a boost in late trade by assuring markets the U.S. administration's policy for a strong dollar will remain unchanged and that a strong dollar is &quot;good&quot; for the economy as it leads to lower interest rates and lower inflation. But the dollar's gains were limited as nerves were still frayed from Tuesday's steep slide in the dollar after Federal Reserve officials elected not to raise U.S. interest rates. &quot;The market is very confused. People are very unsure about the direction and there have been such big swings that it's hard to establish any type of view,&quot; said James Powers, a vice-president in foreign exchange sales and advisory at Westdeutsche Landesbank in New York. The dollar rose to 1.6928/33 marks from 1.6870/80 at the open and to 114.32/37 yen from 113.60/70. The overall U.S. trade gap shrank to $8.5 billion in March, well below market forecasts for a deficit in excess of $10.0 billion. A surprise 4.1 percent jump in U.S. exports prompted economists to upwardly revise their final estimates for first quarter U.S. economic growth to roughly 6.0 percent from the current 5.6 percent preliminary estimate issued weeks ago by the Commerce Department. &quot;It smells like six percent,&quot; said Commerce Undersecretary Everett Ehrlich on Wednesday. The boost to the first quarter's growth measure supported the dollar, dealers said. However, the headline trade figure masked an 8.3 percent rise in the United States' bilateral trade gap with Japan. &quot;Overall, the Japanese trade data were moderately dollar positive, but the Japanese data were a bit negative,&quot; said Richard Vullo, a vice president and trader at Hypobank in New York. The dollar gleaned verbal support from Bundesbank council member Hans-Juergen Koebnick who said he had little objection to the dollar trading at 1.70 marks -- slightly above its current trading level. However, U.S. asset markets lent the dollar little support as the Dow Jones industrials index fell over 10 points in late trade and the 30-year benchmark Treasury lost 22/32 to yield 6.96 percent. In Asia, Japanese officials tried to repair damage done on Tuesday after members of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party called for a rise in the official discount rate, which currently sits at a record low of 0.5 percent. Takahiro Kawase, director of the Bank of Japan's policy planning department, told reporters that the central bank has no plans for an immediate rise in interest rates. Separately, Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told a parliamentary committee that Japanese politicians should refrain from commenting on interest rates. Mitsuzuka also said recent worries over an excessive weakening of the yen have completely disappeared. In other trading, the dollar inched higer to 1.4075/85 Swiss francs by the close from 1.4060/70 after officials at the Swiss central bank added liquidity to the market and announced there was no fundamental reason for the currency's recent rise. The U.S. unit rose to Canadian $1.3677/82 from C$1.3662/67 and the British pound fell to $1.6450/60 from $1.6525/35. The Australian dollar rose to $0.7866/71 from $0.7775/80.

GCAT,GSPO	 Germany's Sandra Voelker lowered her own European 50 metres freestyle short-course record and Costa Rican Olympic champion Claudia Poll made a confident start to her 200 metres freestyle title defence at the world short-course swimming championships on Friday. Voelker, silver medallist behind American Jenny Thompson in Thursday's 100 metres freestyle, established herself as favourite for the women's 50 freestyle by leading qualifiers for the evening's final in a European record 24.62 seconds. Poll, double gold medallist at the 1995 world short-course championships in Rio de Janeiro, led the way in the 200 freestyle and looked unlikely to relinquish her title. She clocked one minute 57.90 seconds and was nearly half a second quicker than her nearest challenger, 1995 bronze medallist Martina Moravcova of Slovakia. But Cuba's Rodolfo Falcon failed to make the final in his defence of the men's 200 metres backstroke title, managing only the 19th-fastest overall time of 2:00.46 -- over five seconds slower than top qualifier Wang Wei of China (1:55.13). Voelker, 50 freestyle bronze medallist and 100 freestyle silver medallist at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, sliced 0.05 seconds from the 24.67 European 50 freestyle mark she set at the European short-course swimming championships in Rostock on December 14 last year. Thompson won her heat in 25.01, the second-fastest time overall, but later failed to qualify for the 200 freestyle final after finishing 13th overall in the heats. Chinese world record-holder Le Jingyi, third behind Thompson and Voelker in Thursday's 100 freestyle and now in danger of losing her 50 freestyle crown, touched second behind Voelker in the last heat for the third best overall time of 25.05. Voelker was back in the water before the end of the session in the Scandinavium indoor arena, securing a place in the 100 backstroke final with the second-fastest heat time of 1:00.10. China's Lu Donghua led the way in 59.94, winning her heat ahead of American defending champion Misty Hyman (1:00.49). German veteran Joerg Hoffmann took pole position in the men's 400 freestyle but faced a challenge in the final from Denmark's Jacob Carstensen and Australia's Grant Hackett, who were both less than a second behind in the heats. Fellow German Jens Kruppa was fastest qualifier in the men's 100 breaststroke. American Amanda Beard, double breaststroke silver medallist at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, just made the women's 200 breaststroke final with the eighth and slowest qualifying time. Beard touched in 2:28.95, more than five seconds behind the pace set by Australian fellow 15-year-old Kristy Ellem (2:23.87).

C18,C181,CCAT	 American Homestar Corp said Monday it had signed a definitive agreement to buy Brilliant Holding Corp for up to 600,000 Homestar shares and options, plus the assumption of about $8 million of debt. Brilliant, a maker of manufactured homes from three plants in Alabama, posted revenues of about $75 million and operating income of about $2.7 million for 1996, Homestar said. It said closing of the deal is scheduled for June 1. The transaction is expected to be accounted for as a pooling of interests and to be accretive to fiscal 1998 earnings, Homestar said. Homestar's co-chief executive officers, Finis Teeter and Laurence Dawson Jr, said the acquisition gives their company &quot;a much broader manufacturing base in the Deep South.&quot; &quot;We plan to replicate our core southwestern market strategy, with multiple manufacturing plants and a strong retail distribution network consisting of both company stores and independent retailers,&quot; they said. American Homestar operates eight home manufacturing plants, 49 company-owned retail centers, and serves over 300 independent retail locations in 24 states.
C17,C172,CCAT	 India's largest private sector company, Reliance Industries Ltd, has no plans to tap the international bond markets again this year after launching a sterling Eurobond on Tuesday, an official said. &quot;One of the basic objectives of tapping sterling was to diversify our investor base,&quot; Mathew Panikar, managing director at Reliance Europe Ltd told Reuters. &quot;We achieved this and plan to diversify to other major global bond markets. (But) it is unlikely we will go to the international bond markets this year,&quot; he said. Earlier, analysts in Bombay said Reliance was looking into launching bonds in marks and yen. Panikar said Reliance Industries might tap these sectors in 1998, &quot;provided there is appetite and we get attractive transaction costs&quot;. Reliance Industries's business consists of textiles, polyester fibres, polymers and petrochemicals. It has also entered new areas such as energy and oil and gas. Reliance is rated Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service and BB+ by Standard &amp; Poor's. On Tuesday it issued a debut sterling bond. The 150 million stg 10-year transaction was priced to yield 165 basis points over gilts. In the last two years, Reliance has raised about $800 million in the U.S. bond markets. -- Aline van Duyn, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7748
C24	 Heavy rains, hail and floods which swept Romania's grain basket areas near the River Danube recently have turned bumper wheat crops into fodder on thousands of hectares, officials and farmers said on Friday. &quot;After so much rain, the wheat crop on 5,000 hectares is good only for animals. It's such a loss,&quot; said Aurel Plosca, head of the Braigal SA holding in the Danube town of Braila. Heavy rains, hail and floods hit Romania during the grain harvesting season, submerging thousands of hectares of cropland and damaging scores of households. The adverse weather had prompted some experts to say they doubted the accuracy of the Agriculture Ministry's estimates of 6.9 million tonnes for the 1997 wheat crop, revised downward from 7.1 million this week. Bucharest officials, including leading politicians, are sticking to the forecasts despite reports of heavy losses in areas like Braila. They said the experts' views were groundless and accused them of undermining Romania's exports interests. A chart displayed in a Braigal office showed there had been 28 rainy days since June 18, when wheat harvesting started in the area, one of Romania's major grain suppliers. &quot;I can't remember anything like that over the past 30 years,&quot; Plosca said, adding that humidity in the soil had prevented the heavy harvesters from entering the fields. On Friday, ponds made by rains on the water-saturated soil marked the landscape alongside the road linking Bucharest to the cropland areas along the Danube. In some areas, sunflower and tobacco crops along the road also looked seriously affected by rains and hail. &quot;Some 560 hectares under wheat as well as other crops are heavily damaged. It's a tragedy because people living here are poor and dependent on farming,&quot; said Victoria Ivascanu, Mayor of the small village of Surdila Greci. Plosca said the state-run Braigal was financially safe as it had managed to take in some 35,000 tonnes of &quot;excellent&quot; milling wheat which it had already sold to &quot;two Western firms&quot;. Earnings from an earlier sale of 25,000 tonnes of barley had also entered Braigal's coffers, he said. &quot;We managed to find a buyer for the fodder wheat which we still have to harvest from those 5,000 hectares, at a price of $90 per tonne, compared to $130 we got for the good wheat.&quot; A few km west of Braila, Grigore Ciobica, the head of the private Horticola farming association in the village of Lacu Sarat, said his members had been less fortunate. &quot;It's a disaster. This wheat has started to germinate, it's finished,&quot; said Ciobica as he walked through the ankle-deep mud in a field of wheat. Ciobica said many residents who had leased land to Horticola had congregated outside his office to ask for their share of &quot;good wheat&quot;. &quot;I'm not God. What can I do ?&quot; Ciobica said. Earlier in the day, the state radio quoted an official in the county of Constanta saying some 85,000 tonnes of wheat stored in silos across the county had started to germinate.
C12,CCAT,GCAT,GCRIM	 Summit Technology Inc and VISX Inc said Wednesday they have settled their U.S. and international patent infringement suits in a agreement that calls for VISX to pay Summit $4.5 million. The settlement includes litigation in Delaware related to Summit's Azema patent and in Canada related to VISX's L'Esperance patents, the companies said in a joint statement. Under the settlement, VISX and Summit have released each other and their customers from claims of past infringement and have cross-licensed each other's foreign patents in the field of laser ablation of corneal tissue, they said.

E11,E12,ECAT,GCAT,GTOUR	 It's quiet on a bright, beautiful mid-afternoon day at Brunei's Jerudong amusement park. Too quiet. Almost nobody but cleaners and security guards were there in early March to enjoy the 90 acres of state-of-the-art rides and magnificently tended gardens by the beach a few miles outside Brunei's capital of Bandar Seri Begawan. You coudn't give away tickets to the park. That's because entry is free -- for residents and foreign tourists alike. Across the road from the park, workers are putting the finishing touches on a five-star, 500-room hotel, with a 24-hour floodlit golf course, a marina and conference facilities due to open in July. OIL RUNNING OUT &quot;Black gold&quot; is slowly running out in the tiny oil sultanate of Brunei and the country -- best known, perhaps, for being ruled by one of the world's wealthiest men -- is placing its bets on tourism. Brunei aims to be a tourism and trade gateway to Borneo, the South China Sea island that is also shared by Malaysia and Indonesia, officials say. &quot;We aim to promote Borneo as a single destination,&quot; said Sheik Jamaluddin Sheik Mohamed, the newly-appointed Head of the Brunei Tourism Unit. &quot;Brunei is the only independent kingdom on the island of Borneo,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;Other (Borneo) states are part of other countries. Visitors can fly direct on Royal Brunei Airlines instead of going through, for example, Kuala Lumpur.&quot; APEC HOST IN 2000 Brunei is aiming to attract one million visitors a year by the year 2000, when the country is due to host its biggest event since independence in 1984 -- the millenium summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation grouping. It attracted some 450,000 last year, almost all of them from neighbouring Malaysia. Some of them come to Jerudong, which gets livelier at night but is never crowded despite the attractive admission price. Down the road from the Jerudong Resort Hotel and the amusement park another key piece of Brunei's future is taking shape, a container port at Muara on the Bay of Brunei. Brunei also aims to be a hub for trade and services for a regional trade area that also encompasses the south Philippines province of Mindanao, Indonesia's Sulawesi island and its three provinces on Borneo and Malaysia Sabah and Sarawak states. EAST ASIAN GROWTH AREA The East Asian Growth Area, as the Borneo trade group is called, is key to Brunei's economic diversification effort. &quot;With a population of 32 million, it will provide opportunities for cooperation through greater access to markets and investment in agriculture, fisheries, tourism, air travel and transport industries and services,&quot; according to Brunei's national development plan for 1996-2000, issued last week. Brunei is sometimes called the &quot;Shellfare state&quot; because the oil is managed by Brunei Shell Petroleum, a 50-50 joint venture between the government and the Royal Dutch Shell group. Bruneians pay no taxes. Health care and most of their education is free. And they can get interest-free loans to buy houses, cars and televisions. But oil, which has given Brunei's 296,000 people a standard of living almost unequalled in the developing world -- per capita GDP is around $17,000 and projected to rise to $20,000 in the year 2000 -- is no longer the engine of the economy. The oil sector's contribution to the economy has been halved in the last decade to 36 percent of GDP in 1995 from 76 percent in 1985, the 1996-200 development plan states. FIVE PERCENT GROWTH The Brunei economy is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 5.0 percent in the five-year plan -- the oil sector at just two percent and the non-oil sector a robust 10 percent. Brunei's petroleum reserves are expected to last another 20 to 40 years, depending on how fast it wants to pump oil. In 1990, the country adopted a ceiling of 150,000 barrels per day (bpd). But to compensate for falling oil prices in the early 1990s, Brunei has raised that to 175,000 bpd in 1995, of which it exports 96 percent. The development plan said those levels would be maintained. Brunei still has plenty of gas reserves, though as with the case with oil, official figures are unavailable. The development plan says liquefied natural gas production is expected to increase to 159 million cubic metres a day in the current five-year plan from 138.9 million in the previous five years. SULTAN RICHEST MAN The salad days of $30-a-barrel oil in the late 1970s and early 1980s helped the highly secretive Brunei Investment Agency build a formidable portfolio of $40 billion to $60 billion, which is socked away in overseas currency and stock funds and properties such London's prestigious Dorchester Hotel. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah is sometimes called the richest man in the world because as absolute monarch he has the ultimate say over how this money is used. But Brunei-based diplomats say much of the annual income earned from these investments -- some $3-$4 billion annually -- is used to help pay for the country's development projects. Major allocations are for the food and beverage industry. Brunei currently imports around 80 percent of its food. All of its beef comes from three cattle stations owned by the sultan. With a total land area of 5,500 square miles, the cattle ranches are as big as Brunei itself. STRONG BRUNEI DOLLAR The Brunei dollar has long been pegged to the Singapore dollar, giving the Bruneian currency a strength that is not necessarily reflected in economic fundamentals. But bankers and diplomats here dismissed the idea the two currencies would be delinked any time soon. Such talk rattled the Singaporean money markets in late February. A decoupling followed by devaluation of the Brunei dollar would probably cause an unacceptable inflationary spiral in the import-dependent kingdom, diplomats said. But a weaker currency would be good news for tourists who now find the country expensive and dry -- alcohol is forbidden in the Islamic republic. A weaker Brunei unit would also be a big boost for the export industries and Borneo trade hub the country is developing for the day when the oils run dry as well.
M11,MCAT	 Mexican stocks reversed their early slide and were heading upwards for the pyschological 5,100-barrier in midday trading on Monday. Dealers said share prices gained after bargain-hunters stepped in, taking refuge from volatile equity markets in Brazil. &quot;We're seeing Latam funds flowing into Mexico rather than Brazil, which still has problems, as prices look good here,&quot; a floor trader said. The leading IPC share index was up 26.21 points, or 0.52 percent, at 5,093.24.   In Sao Paulo, the Bovespa index of most traded stocks was down 1.96 percent to 12,019 points. Dealers said that volume was much thinner than for many recent sessions; thus light buying by stockpickers had an exaggerated impact on the market. &quot;There's hardly any shouting on the floor; it's very quiet down here.  It rebounded because a few stocks had reached rock-bottom,&quot; another floor trader said. Financial firm Bancomer A's shares were the most active, accounting for more than one-quarter of a slow total volume of 46.9 million shares traded.

GCAT,GSPO	 The traditional wire mesh fencing mask is to be replaced by a new perspex version to increase the sport's appeal on television. The International Fencing Federation said on Thursday the American-designed mask will be introduced to all grand prix events from January 1. If successful it will be used at the 2000 Olympics. The new mask features a broad perspex window inserted at eye level into a traditional mask. The idea is to make the sport more television friendly by allowing cameras to capture expressions of competitors during bouts.

C11,CCAT	 South Korean companies said on Thursday they would go ahead with investment plans in China, saying the death of Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping was no cause for concern to investors. &quot;Whoever leads China, his utmost task would be to promote economic prosperity,&quot; said Park Tae-joon, a China expert at the giant Daewoo Group. A spokesman for Daewoo, one of the four biggest industrial conglomerates in South Korea, said it would double its current $2 billion investment in China within two years. Daewoo's projects include production of car parts, cement and telecommunications equipment. By the year 2005, Daewoo investments in China would reach around $8 billion, he said. &quot;I don't expect any dramatic changes in China's economic programmes because Deng's death has long been anticipated,&quot; said Chun Jae-wook, a senior fellow at the state-financed Korea Institute for International Economic Policy. Other major conglomerates also said their investment plans in China would proceed as scheduled. The Samsung Group  said its investment in China would top $2.5 billion by the year 2000 against the current $1 billion. Its flagship Samsung Electronics has pumped in $300 million so far to set up five Chinese production bases whose combined sales totalled $1 billion in 1996, a Samsung spokesman said. LG Electronics Co, flagship of the LG Group LUGG.CN, said it still planned to invest $3 billion by 2005 to make consumer electronics products in Beijing, Shanghai and other Chinese cities. Industry analysts in Seoul said China's leadership looked stable, but added they might differ on how quickly the market should be liberalised. &quot;Basically they are all in favour of economic reforms,&quot; said a Trade Ministry official. South Korea's approved investment in China soared to $4.1 billion at the end of 1996, about 10 times the figure in 1992, when South Korea and China established diplomatic ties, ministry figures showed. Two-way trade reached $19.8 billion in 1996, up from $16.5 billion in 1995. South Korea's exports to China totalled $11.42 billion last year, up from $9.14 billion in 1995, and imports $8.4 billion, against $7.4 billion.
E21,E211,E41,ECAT,GCAT,GJOB	 Australian Prime Minister John Howard on Friday defended his push for tax reform against criticism it would do nothing for unemployment, the country's most pressing problem. Labor opposition leader Kim Beazley attacked Howard's decision on Wednesday to examine a value-added tax -- a &quot;goods and services tax&quot; (GST) -- for the mountains of paperwork it would impose on business. &quot;This might be a bonanza for accountants, but it would be a smothering hand on job creation and economic growth,&quot; Beazley wrote in a newspaper commentary. Howard, who leads a Liberal-National coalition government, has not determined how to change the tax system but said on Wednesday he was launching an inquiry and would offer a policy to voters before the next election. But his long-standing support for GST and recent emphasis that it must be an option appear to show where his heart lies, even though voters rejected a similar proposal in 1993. Howard told reporters on Friday tax reform would help fight unemployment, currently stalled near 8.5 percent. &quot;Any tax reform that leads to more productive Australian businesses, any tax reform that leads to more exports, any tax reform that encourages more investment will make a huge contribution to higher economic growth and therefore feed directly into higher levels of employment,&quot; Howard said. Australia's current taxation system has attracted criticism for its excessive reliance on income tax, the top marginal rate of which is nearly 50 percent and starts as low as 1.5 times average earnings. Indirect taxes apply inconsistently on goods and barely at all on services, the fastest growing sector of production. States impose a variety of narrow indirect taxes, such as stamp duty on land sales, but cannot raise enough money on their own and must rely on large federal grants. Australia's top court, the High Court, last week took away much of the states' independent revenue when it ruled that some of their biggest charges were unconstitutional. In short, critics say, Australia's tax system is a mess and the solution is GST. But reform has been intensely controversial. In the 1993 election, the then Labor government was poised to lose office with unemployment running at 11 percent but it won handsomely after campaigning against the coalition's proposal for GST. Howard came to power last year as voters turned their backs on 13-years of Labor rule. Howard says value-added tax, common in Europe, would boost the economy by allowing for a cut in income tax, which he says is so high it discourages people from earning and investing. &quot;This is very much a policy that I could describe as an LPT policy -- it's a lower personal tax policy,&quot; he said. Economists, however, calculate that replacing current indirect taxes with a GST no higher than the 15 percent proposed in 1993 might not raise enough money to cut income taxes.

The UDF party, junior partner in the ruling centre-right coalition, had supported an amendment to block government plans in the 1997 budget to raise petrol duties in line with inflation. The lower house of parliament rejected the amendment by 100 votes to 63.

C15,C152,CCAT	 Morgan Stockbroking was recommending building products group James Hardie Industries Ltd as a buy investment, reflecting anticipated benefits to come from an expected residential construction recovery this year. &quot;James Hardie's Australian-based activities will benefit from a residential construction recovery in calendar 1997,&quot; Morgan analysts said in an investment report. &quot;However, heightened competition in fibre cement from CSR Ltd, Humes Ltd and others will dull the normally-leveraged profit recovery,&quot; the analysts said.   Morgan said Hardie's losses in pipelines and bathroom products should be stemmed in the current year ended March 31, 1997. Hardie's major profit growth segment would be the United States where both fibre cement and gypsum were undergoing capacity expansions, Morgan analysts said. &quot;Despite new competitors appearing on the horizon, fibre cement prices are being maintained and margins are improving,&quot; the Morgan report said. Hardie's sale of its irrigation and building services had released funds for fibre cement expansion, the analysts said.   Further non-core assets would become more marketable as the dwelling construction cycle improved in Australia, they said. Morgan was forecasting net profit for the current 1996/97 year of A$215.5 million compared with an actual $32.2 million in 1995/96. A maintained 13 cents a share fully-franked dividend total for the current year was anticipated. At the time of writing the report, James Hardie's share price was $3.75 compared with A$4.11 at 2.20 p.m. (0420 GMT) on Monday, which was four cents lower than Friday's close. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800

GCAT,GPOL,GVOTE	 Former military ruler Didier Ratsiraka took an early lead on Monday in partial, provisional results from Sunday's presidential election on the Indian Ocean island of Madagascar. The retired 59-year-old admiral was among 15 candidates including preachers, pharmacists and Marxists vying to take charge of the vast island and its 14 million people who live in chronic poverty. Partial, provisional results showed Ratsiraka taking between 25 and 45 percent of counted votes in Sunday's poll followed by prime minister and interim president Norbert Ratsirahonana and U.S.-educated millionaire businessman Herizo Razafimahaleo. National Assembly Speaker Richard Andriamanjato, a Marxist pastor, was in fourth place. Former president Albert Zafy, 69, whose impeachment by parliament in July led to the election, followed with a strong showing in his home region of Antsiranana and the southern region of Toliara but both areas are sparsely-populated. Zafy, who was charged by parliament with abusing his authority, was elected president in 1993 to succeed Ratsiraka. Political analysts said it seemed more and more probable none of the 15 candidates for the presidency would be able to obtain the absolute majority to triumph in the first round of voting. They said a second round looked highly likely pitting Ratsiraka against either Ratsirahonana or Razafimahaleo. But final official results were not expected on the world's fourth largest island for two or three weeks and a second round would probably not take place before the start of the new year. Ratsiraka received a high level of support during campaigning, surprising analysts. He returned to the island from 19 months of voluntary exile in France at the end of September. He was reviled by many of his people in the early 1990s for using the army to resist the pro-democracy movement. The partial, provisional results showed Ratsirahonana taking 29.97 percent of the counted votes in the Malagasy capital Antananarivo compared with 28.18 percent for Ratsiraka. The former military ruler took 47.39 percent of counted votes in his home region of Toamasina compared with 22.37 percent for Ratsirahonana, the early results showed. Razafimahaleo took 15.95 percent of the counted votes in the capital and 15.97 of the counted votes in Toamasina region. Turnout in Sunday's election was put at a little more than 50 percent. Several hours after voting started on Sunday, Interior Minister Charles Sylvain Rabotoarison denounced what he said were attempts to sabotage the election, saying police in the capital had received reports of various irregularities. Speaking on Radio Madagascar, he cited instances of &quot;phantom electoral lists&quot;, voters' cards for under-age people and people with three or four voters' cards and said the reports were being investigated. Many intending voters complained that their names did not appear on the poll register, and some voters said they had been offered bribes to support a particular candidate.

GCAT,GSPO	 Manchester United may consider legal action to force an extension of the premier league season after officials rejected their plea on Thursday for help in easing a fixture backlog. Championship leaders United still have six league games and at least one European Cup match to squeeze in before the May 11 deadline. But their request fell on deaf ears as the premier league's two-man board saw no reason to lengthen the season. United chairman Martin Edwards was furious at the decision, branded the officials &quot;amateurs&quot; and vowed that United would appeal and consider legal action. &quot;The premier league is supposed to be the best league in the world, and I thought the best team was supposed to win it, but with these obstacles in the way it won't happen,&quot; he said. &quot;They have shown they are an amateur body. We will obviously appeal over this ludicrous decision. If the F.A . (Football Association) reject that appeal, I do not know whether we can take it to the law. That's something we will have to look at because it's that serious.&quot;
M12,MCAT	 U.S. Treasuries will remain the favourite destination for Japanese money, despite a scare sparked by comments from Japan's prime minister, analysts said on Tuesday. Ryutaro Hashimoto said in New York on Monday he hoped the U.S. would co-operate to maintain exchange stability so that Japan would not be tempted to sell Treasuries and buy gold instead. Treasuries dropped a quarter point and the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its second biggest one-day drop in history after his remarks. &quot;Treasuries have had their chance to react to Hashimoto's comments so I wouldn't imagine there would be any further follow through,&quot; said Adrian Schmidt, international economist at Chase in London. At 1117 GMT, the U.S. long bond was quoted at 99-05 to yield 6.69 percent, up from 99-03 in Tokyo and 98-31 at the close in New York on Monday. Analysts said Hashimoto's comments were not likely to prompt Japanese government institutions to dump Treasuries. &quot;Hashimoto seemed to imply that Japanese official sources might sell Treasuries which is highly unlikely,&quot; said Rob Hayward, economic adviser at BankAmerica in London. &quot;He seems determined to stabilise the yen and that would have completely the opposite effect as we saw overnight with the yen strengthening.&quot; The dollar/yen was at 114.66/76, having slipped to 114.10 overnight and compared with 115.30/35 in late Europe on Monday. Hayward said private institutions would also be reluctant to sell their U.S. holdings given that the Japanese Ministry of Finance (MOF) had previously encouraged overseas investment. Indeed the MOF played down Hashimoto's comments, saying Japan had not sold Treasuries and had no intention of doing so. However if the yen strengthened Japanese investors might be less tempted by Treasuries and might take some profits, Hayward said. &quot;But that is something which is out of the hands of the government and which has always been there,&quot; Hayward said. Only if there was an escalation in diplomatic tension would this view be changed, analysts said. &quot;Throughout the day Japanese officials will probably be downplaying the importance of the comments,&quot; said Hayward. &quot;The key will be what Rubin says this afternoon and I imagine he will also try to calm the waters.&quot; He said if that was the case the U.S. market was expected to gradually claw back some of its losses. U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin will speak to a forum on the American City at 1315 GMT in Washington and was expected to be asked about the overnight developments. Hashimoto's comments sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling 192.25 points or 2.5 percent to 7,604.26. But unless this developed into a longer term rout bonds were not likely to benefit, analysts said. &quot;The question for equities is whether the mutual fund money continues to pour in or whether it sits on the sidelines for a while,&quot; said Ian Harwood, head of strategy and economics at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson Securities in London. &quot;I doubt whether it will go into Treasuries rather than equities. People think equities can do nothing but go up in a straight line.&quot; He said while the events of the last 24 hours might bring that view into question, investors were likely to stay in cash and equities rather than switching to bonds. Schmidt said the fact that the stock market reacted more than Treasuries said more about the condition of equities than about Hashimoto's comments. &quot;I don't think the comments that were made give any reason to suppose that they would trigger flows from equities to Treasuries,&quot; he said. But analysts said investors in Treasuries should not get complacent as the market was nearing the top of its range. &quot;Even though the inflation numbers have been very good the strength of the economy is likely to continue,&quot; said Schmidt. &quot;The weakness of the second quarter is likely to be temporary and a return to above trend growth is probably going to lead to yields rising through to the end of the year.&quot;
GCAT,GDIS	 Two earthquakes measuring 5.9 and 4.9 on the Richter scale rocked Birjand in northeastern Iran over the past 24 hours but there were no reports of casualties, the official Iranian news agency IRNA reported on Saturday. The first quake, which hit at 5.28 p.m. on Friday (1258 GMT) with an intensity of 5.9, was considered an aftershock of the force 7.1 earthquake which hit Birjand and Qaen on May 10, IRNA said. The May earthquake killed more than 1,500 people and made 50,000 homeless. The geophysics institute of Tehran University said the epicenter of Friday's quake, which damaged 60 houses in the area, was 460 km (285 miles) south of Mashhad. The second quake shook Birjand at 1.16 p.m. (0846 GMT) on Saturday. Tehran University said the epicenter was also about 460 km south of Mashhad. There were no immediate reports of damage. Iran has been hit by at least three major earthquakes in the past year as well as scores of milder tremors and thousands of aftershocks that U.N. officials say have stretched the country's relief supplies to the limit. Earthquakes measuring force four and above can cause widespread damage in a populated area.
C31,C313,CCAT	 The launch of Britain's Channel 5 (C5) television station has boosted the commercial share of viewing to a four-year high of 57 percent, C5 said on Wednesday. The channel said this had boosted the volume of commercial impacts and justified the advertising industry's support for the creation of a fifth national terrestrial station. Channel 5 sales director Nick Milligan said he was expecting a seven percent share of adult commercial impacts by the end of the year. He is forecasting a 10 percent share of 16-34 impacts. The channel said all advertising deals had been fulfilled and its current share of impacts was as forecast ahead of its launch. Industry specialists Zenith Media are forecasting 1997 advertising revenue of 80 million stg for C5. The channel, launched on March 30, said it was on course for a five percent share of TV viewing by the end of 1997. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717

C15,C151,CCAT	 Bankgesellschaft Berlin, Germany's sixth largest bank, said on Monday that it expected to pay an unchanged dividend in 1996 and 1997. Responding to enquiries, a spokeswoman for the bank confirmed the bank's incoming chief executive, Wolfgang Rupf, was correctly cited in a report as saying the bank planned a pay out of 1.10 marks per five mark share for 1996 and 1997. Such a dividend would imply an 11 mark pay out per 50 mark share value, the same as in 1995. She added that Rupf expected an operating profit before provisions of between 600 million and one billion marks in 1997. The bank said last Friday that bad debt worries had forced it into setting aside 2.2 billion marks of provisions in 1996. -- Bonn Newsroom +49 228 260 97150
E21,E211,ECAT	 Argentina's newly-appointed head of taxation, Carlos Silvani, said he will concentrate on identifying entire sets of economic activities where tax evasion is rampant, the daily Ambito Financiero reported Monday. &quot;The problem here is not one of naming tax evaders but rather of finding whole sets of economic sectors that do not pay their taxes properly,&quot; Silvani told the financial daily. &quot;And this includes large, middle-size and small contributors.&quot;   Silvani was appointed Friday to head the General Tax Authority (DGI). He is to replace Carlos Sanchez who will move to a post as advisor to the Economic Ministry. Silvani will take over the DGI sometime in October after completing his current assigment in China as an International Monetary Fund (IMF) tax expert, the newspaper said. The economist said he &quot;fully trusted&quot; DGI's personnel and said they stacked up well against most of what he had seen in tax offices around the world. He added the DGI needed to concentrate on improving its system to measure evasion. As an IMF expert, Silvani has been assigned in numerous occasions to work in Argentina's DGI. &quot;Believe me, I know this office quite well,&quot; he told Ambito Financiero. -- Daniel Helft, Buenos Aires Newsroom + 541 318 0663

M13,M132,MCAT	 The dollar slumped against the yen in early Europe as comments from Japan's &quot;Mr Yen&quot; stirred up bubbling market fears of central bank intervention. Influential Finance Ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara pulled the rug out from under dollar/yen's feet when he said the past year's movements raised the chance the Japanese currency could strengthen, possibly to 103 per dollar. The U.S. unit swooped from around 124.70 yen just before the remarks to a low of 123.70. &quot;People are on tenterhooks about whether we actually see any intervention,&quot; said Nigel Richardson, economist at Yamaichi. &quot;People are aware there's a chance of some kind of intervention if they're really serious about (yen weakness),&quot; said Richardson, who is an international economist at Yamaichi. Intervention fears gripped the market and shook the dollar on Wednesday after a Japanese wire report that the G3 nations -- Japan, the U.S. and Germany -- were studying the possibility of concerted selling of dollars for yen. &quot;The fear of intervention is clearly rising, but the success of the mere threat to intervene is probably enough to keep the G3 from actually executing intervention for now,&quot; said Klaus Baader, international economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. Although Germany -- keen to boost exports and spur economic growth -- is thought less troubled then Japan by the dollar's current levels, the Sakakibara shock waves rippled through dollar/mark too. It fell to a 1.7097 marks low from late Wednesday's 1.7210/15, though was back at 1.7118/23 by 0810 GMT. Mark/yen felt the force of the upbeat Japanese currency, skidding to 72.25/28 from 72.57/59. Analysts said the interest rate scenario was also working in the yen's favour, as speculation grew of Japanese tightening. In the U.S., by contrast, yesterday's Beige Book release gives no indication the Fed will have to raise rates fast, they said. In its latest Beige Book on business conditions, the Federal Reserve said the U.S. economy expanded moderately over the last two months while wages and retail prices were generally subdued. Fed policymakers will use the findings when they meet on May 20 to consider whether to tighten, after raising rates at their last meeting in March for the first time in more than two years. &quot;The story of moderate growth reduces expectations of an interest rate rise in the future, and undermines the dollar. Compare that with Japan, where there's talk about economic recovery coming through and talk about an early rate rise,&quot; said Yamaichi's Richardson. Japanese vice finance minister Tadashi Ogawa moved, however, to dampen those expectations. Japan's current monetary stance was appropriate, though some saw the rise in long-term interest rates as reflecting a brighter economic outlook, he said. Ogawa said Sakakibara's comment had not been a prediction of future market movements. Sakakibara had in fact remarked that dollar/yen had moved an average of 23 yen per year in the past 10-year period, meaning the yen would strengthen to around 103 to the dollar if it gained 23 yen from current levels, Ogawa told a news conference. Elsewhere, sterling settled far beneath previous European closing levels after diving overnight on a report quoting an unnamed Labour Party source as saying the pound should rejoin Europe's exchange rate mechanism in 2001 at a rate of 2.50 marks. The UK Treasury said there was no truth in the report. Sterling was quoted at 2.7854/64 marks and $1.6260/67 at 0847 GMT versus late Wednesday's European levels of 2.8151/61 and $1.6366/75. -- Abigail Levene, London Newsroom +44-171-542-8968

M11,MCAT	 Brussels Bel-20 index which closed down two percent on Tuesday was expected to take a cue from Wall Street in coming days, but traders said further falls in the U.S. were likely to trigger a major sell-off. &quot;It's wait-and-see for investors, if the Dow closes in positive territory it will boost the Bel-20 in coming days, but if it closes negative we'll plunge,&quot; said one trader. The Brussels blue chip Bel-20 closed down 1.96 percent, or 42.08 points, at 2,104.29 after earlier falling over three percent.   Wall Street has fallen over four percent in the last two days of trade due to fears of further interest rate hikes. Traders said investors were also eyeing U.S. NAPM figures for for an indication on U.S. rates. &quot;There's no panic in the market, a lot of players are on the sidelines but some market players are taking the opportunity to pick up cheap stocks,&quot; another trader said. Financials were hardest hit as they are more likely to suffer from further U.S. interest rate hikes.   &quot;Financials were under pressure, because of interest rate worries in the U.S.,&quot; trader Paul de Lophem at brokerage Mignon, Hanart, Declerck said. Financial Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL) fell 4.38 percent to 7,420 francs and insurer Royale Belge dropped 4.32 percent to 8,420 francs. Financial group Fortis AG ended down 4.07 percent at 5,900 francs. Elsewhere holding company Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL) closed up 0.7 percent at 5,010 francs.   GBL and its unit Electrafina benefitted from news that several shareholders of Cie de Suez wanted Suez to distribute some of its cash ahead of a possible merger with Lyonnaise des Eaux. Electrafina, which closed up 0.6 percent at 3,490 francs, owns 8.3 percent of Suez. &quot;GBL is positive because of the Suez story and the same stands for Electrafina,&quot; added de Lophem. -- Paul de Bendern, Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6815, Fax +32 2 230 7710

M14,M141,MCAT	 CBOT corn futures closed narrowly mixed with the market underpinned by a shift in focus by funds to the corn pit from the soybean pit, traders said. Funds bought at least 20 million bushels of corn with Griffin Trading the key purchaser of eight million bushels of March, 2.5 million of May and one million bushels of July, traders said. Smith Barney bought six million May and Cargill Inc sold six million bushels of March, they said. Fundamentals were little changed with U.S. corn exports continuing at a steady pace and farmer selling remained sporadic. &quot;There may be a little unwinding of the bean/corn spreads because soybeans really took off this week and corn didn't,&quot; a trader said. Position squaring was noted before the three day weekend. CBOT futures markets will be closed Monday in observance of the U.S. President's Day holiday. Position also was noted before the release late Friday of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Commitments of Traders report. Corn closed 3/4 cent per bushel lower to 1/4 higher, with March down 1/2 at $2.74.   Corn futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 46,000 contracts, slightly above the 45,303 traded Thursday. In corn options, Farmers Commodities Corp sold 600 May $2.70 puts at five to 5-3/8 cents and Goldenberg Hehmeyer bought 400 March $2.80 calls at 7/8 cent, traders said.

C13,C24,CCAT,GCAT,GDIS	 India's air traffic controllers on Thursday said a Kazakh Airlines' crew's lack of English was a contributing factor in the world's worst mid-air collision in which 349 people died. Everyone aboard a Kazakh cargo plane and a Saudi Arabia Airlines passenger jet were killed when the two aircraft collided near Delhi last November. The Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) Guild, in its submissions to a probe into the accident, said language difficulties caused some communication gap during radio contact with the Kazakh plane, A.K. Bhardwaj, Assistant General Secretary of the Guild told Reuters. The submissions were made to a court of enquiry probing the collision between a Saudi Boeing 747 and a Kazakh Ilyushin Il-76. But a Kazakh civil aviation official blamed air traffic control at New Delhi airport for the accident. &quot;We think air traffic control at New Delhi airport is not satisfactorily organised, and minor mistakes...may lead to such large loss of life,&quot; Bekbulat Salimov, acting chairman of the Air Space Usage and Civil Aviation Committee, told Reuters in Almaty. N.A.K. Sarma, the lawyer representing the Airports Authority of India in the probe said: &quot;The single corridor for the Delhi airport has not contributed to this accident as a separate corridor is provided purely to meet traffic congestion.&quot; ATC's Bhardwaj said the language problem with the Kazakh crew was not an isolated case. &quot;This is a regular problem that we face with the crews of most of the airlines coming from the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) countries,&quot; he said. Bhardwaj added that the language barrier was one of contributing factors and not the prime reason behind the crash. &quot;Decoding of the black boxes has clearly established that the Kazakh plane had deviated from the height assigned to it and that is the main reason behind the accident,&quot; he said. Britain's Air Accident Investigation Branch and the Aviation Institute at Moscow decoded the flight recorders of the two planes. TC had instructed the Kazakh airliner to fly at 15,000 feet and the Saudi plane to maintain a height of 14,000 feet, and the crash could have been avoided had the instructions been followed, Bhardwaj said. But Salimov said in astatement that &quot;the most probable reasons for the crash&quot; were the fact that New Delhi airport had only one take-off and landing runway and the absence of secondary radar control. &quot;This does not allow the Air Traffic Control operator to see on his radar screen a difference in altitudes of planes flying towards each other,&quot; the release said. Kazakh Airlines had argued that their plane lost altitude suddenly in thick cloud after severe turbulence. But the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, which oversees Indian air traffic and airports, rejected the Kazakh submission that turbulence caused the collision and blamed the airplane's faulty equipment for the descent. Saudi Arabia Airlines last month also blamed the Kazakh cargo plane for the accident.

M12,MCAT	 The blistering rally in Italian bond futures has left technical indicators hugely overbought, but with EMU convergence trades calling the shots analysts said the market should have no problem reaching 138.00 near term. Once BTPs do peak however, the correction will be savage, they added on Wednesday, with the market shedding at least four or five points in a matter of days. &quot;We're getting to ridiculous levels -- the nine-day Relative Strength Index is at 87 percent,&quot; said Marc Ostwald, technical analyst at London Bond Broking here. &quot;But nevertheless, we can probably get a bit further.&quot; He said in pure spread terms, even if the German market is unchanged, a 10-year BTP/Bund gap of 75 basis points meant another point and a half on the Italian future. &quot;That would give us 138.00 which would definitely be the upper limit in the short term,&quot; he said. September BTPs have surged almost eight points since the 129.07 low on June 10. By 1000 GMT, they were up 57 basis points at 136.83, off a new record high earlier of 136.94. The 10-year BTP/Bund spread was at 93 basis points, down from 117 basis points just over a week ago. Even the 10-year cash yield has broken through the 6.50 percent psychological barrier. By 1000 GMT the 6.75 percent bond due February 2007 was yielding 6.46 percent. &quot;When the momentum is so strong, you end up trying to call the top of the market the whole time because it's so severely overbought,&quot; said Ostwald. But he added he would not sell the market just yet, but wait for it to push slightly higher. &quot;My best guess is 138.00, and from there I'm looking for a retracement down to the 133.00 level pretty quickly,&quot; he said. Ostwald noted a 50 percent retracement of the rally since June would give a target level of 132.82. Daniele Castelnuovo, an analyst at Banca Euromobiliare in Milan, was even more optimistic. He expected the September BTP to reach the lofty heights of 140.00 within the next 10 days. &quot;The uptrend is strong and the ultimate target is 140.00. I don't see any reason for any retracement for the time being,&quot; he said. Castelnuovo agreed European economic and monetary union (EMU) convergence trades and a buoyant U.S. Treasury market were the driving forces behind the BTPs' rally. &quot;The only risk is an unforeseeable fall in U.S. T-bonds which could impair the general uptrend of European markets,&quot; he said. Analysts at MCM YieldWatch in London said hourly studies suggested the market would push to 137.05, a Fibonacci projection level, with the potential for a pull back from there. &quot;However, over the short term, the potential is still seen for further gains towards 137.71,&quot; they said in a note for clients. Ostwald noted most of the buying interest at current levels was professional rather than retail. &quot;One worrying thing is there's not a lot of retail involved, it's traders pushing the market up,&quot; he said. -- Jennifer Scott, International Bonds Unit +44 171 542 8682
C31,C311,CCAT	 Bangladesh has started importing 200,000 tonnes of urea fertiliser to meet shortages, a Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC) official said. The country has stocks of 192,185 tonnes of urea, against demand for 2.3 million tonnes, BCIC commercial director Mohammad Masudur Rahman said late on Thursday. Seven ships carrying a total of 82,679 tonnes of urea had already reached the country and three more with 33,000 tonnes were expected to arrive on Friday, he told Reuters. The rest of the 200,000 tonnes were scheduled to arrive by mid-February. Corporation officials said the domestic urea fertiliser shortfall this year was estimated at 350,000 tonnes, with domestic production at some 1.95 million tonnes. The Karnafuli Fertiliser Company (KAFCO), a Bangladesh-Japan joint venture factory near Chittagong, would procure 150,000 tonnes of urea, they said. The remaining 200,000 tonnes would be imported, mostly from Indonesia and Libya. Bangladesh, traditionally a urea exporter, sold 438,000 tonnes in 1994/95 (July/June) to Vietnam, Sri Lanka, India and China, but later turned into an importer. Officials said domestic demand for fertiliser had increased sharply since 1995/96, when a major urea plant, Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Limited, was shut down because of a short supply of natural gas. At least 17 farmers who tried that year to break into fertiliser warehouses and loot supplies were killed in clashes with police, officials say. The imports and buying from KAFCO would cost Bangladesh about $1.0 million and less than half of that would return to the exchequer because fertiliser sales to farmers were heavily subsidised, BCIC officials said. &quot;We are also facing a number of problems in reaching fertiliser to the farmers' level,&quot; one BCIC official said. He said labour unrest at Chittagong and Mongla ports delayed unloading, and frequent suspension of ferry services due to falling river levels disrupted transportation within the country. Lack of gas supply, overhauling and maintenance of factories and mechanical disorders were the main causes for sluggish production at six fertiliser plants run by the BCIC, he added. Agriculture secretary Shawkat Ali said the government needed to distribute 12,000 tonnes of urea every day during the peak farming season between January and March. The figure was 11,000 tonnes in the week ended on Thursday, he told Reuters. Last year's daily average was below 10,000 tonnes. BCIC's Rahman said: &quot;The government is fully alert about problems it faces in hadling fertiliser distribution. We are dealing (with) them firmly.&quot;

GCAT,GSPO	 Juergen Klinsmann's return to the English premier league is far from certain despite British newspaper reports that he is set to rejoin Tottenham at the end of the season, sources close to the player said on Tuesday. The Germany captain, who has decided to leave Bayern Munich at the end of the season because he is unhappy with the way he has been treated at the club, has had offers to play in Spain, Italy and Turkey as well as England. Although Klinsmann is attracted by a return to Tottenham, where he was very successful two seasons ago, he may still be lured back to Italy where he used to play for Internazionale Milan. Ailing English premier league side Everton, who were reported to be having talks with Klinsmann this week, have a big task on their hands to get his signature. &quot;There are offers from Italy and England but it is not clear where he is going yet,&quot; the sources said. &quot;Tottenham cannot be ruled out. I think Juergen is more likely to take up an offer from a London club (than Everton).&quot; Klinsmann, who recently became a father for the first time, said he would not announce his decision until the German season finished at the end of this month. Bayern said he had not made up his mind yet about his future. Klinsmann has said his priorities at the moment were with his family and helping Bayern win the German title. He left London club Tottenham amid considerable acrimony with chairman Alan Sugar after just one season. But Klinsmann has settled his differences with Sugar, the sources said. Some Munich football followers believe, however, that Klinsmann is more likely to return to Italy than England. He has a house near Milan and his wife is believed to like the area.

C13,CCAT,E21,E211,ECAT	 Poland's finance ministry said on Tuesday it will increase excise tax on petrol by 0.03 zloty per litre as of May 28 to make sure the 1997 budgetary revenues are met.   &quot;The finance ministry informs that as of May 28 the levels of the excise tax on petrol and diesel fuel are increased by three groszes a litre. The increase is aimed at meeting revenue targets from the tax,&quot; it said in a statement. The excise tax on imported fuel is now 876 zlotys per tonne of 94-octane leaded petrol, 791 zlotys per tonne of unleaded petrol and 440 zlotys per tonne of diesel. The tax's rise of three per litre entails a rise of some 30 zlotys per tonne. Last week, Finance Minister Marek Belka said he did not expect the increase to significantly lift the price of petrol or boost inflation. Industry sources, who asked not to be named, then said that the ministry decided to raise the tax only after the country's biggest fuel refinery Petrochemia Plock agreed not to raise its prices despite the tax increase. The head of Poland's liquid fuel chamber Andrzej Szczesniak had earlier said an excise tax rise could boost prices of imported fuel but not necessarily by the same amount as distributors could lower their margins, now at 9-15 groszes per litre. -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700
M12,MCAT	 Italian bond futures ended firm after an afternoon of pottering around in a holiday vacuum. The Italian cash market closed at midsession ahead of a three-day weekend, meaning the London market thinned out as well. On the cash front, the July 2007 Btp ended 19 basis points up at 101.22 and the yield was 6.68 percent with the spread over the 10-year Bund at 101 basis points. The September Btp future on LIFFE, which going until the normal close, was 22 basis points higher at 135.45. BTP futures managed to follow Treasuries higher, helped by U.S. industrial production data.   Dealers said earlier locals had tried to push Btps down around midsession before they then bobbed up. &quot;But there's no one about to do anything,&quot; a broker in London said. The Italian market reopens on Monday, when it will be looking forward to preliminary inflation data for August from 11 sample cities due on Thursday and Friday. --Milan bureau +39 2 66129507
GCAT,GPOL,GVOTE	 Niger's military president on Friday postponed parliamentary elections to November 10 and created a new independent electoral commission to replace the body dissolved during July presidential polls. A presidential decree said the new 33-member commission would be fully independent of the West African country's political powers and would be headed by a magistrate to be named later. It will include representatives of political parties and people from outside politics. Interior Minister Idi Ango Omar said on Monday the election -- scheduled for September 22 -- would have to be postponed. Electoral officials began revising electoral lists on Wednesday to ensure anyone omitted or wrongly registered for the July poll would be able to vote. Voting in the July 7 presidential election had to be extended to a second day because many areas had not received electoral lists and voter cards. Military leader General Ibrahim Bare Mainassara sacked the electoral commission on the second day of voting and appointed a new body which declared him the winner with 52.22 percent of votes cast. His four civilian opponents spent two weeks under house arrest and the Supreme Court rejected a request from three of them that the results be scrapped. Mainassara seized power on January 27, ending a paralysing 16-month political standoff between civilian president Mahamane Ousmane and his opponents who held the majority in parliament. The new 83-seat parliament will replace the military National Salvation Council appointed by Mainassara after the coup.
C15,C152,C18,C181,CCAT	 Selecta Dairy Products, a unit of RFM Corp, climbed 28 centavos, or 12 percent, to 2.60 pesos by mid-session on Monday on news its operations will not be merged with America's International Dairy Queen Inc, brokers said. International Dairy Queen's ice cream franchise was recently acquired by Selecta's parent unit RFM Corp. &quot;The positive thing about Selecta's operations not absorbing Dairy Queen's is that Selecta will remain focussed on its business which is ice cream manufacturing where it is doing well,&quot; Cilette Liboro, research head at Citisecurities Inc said.   RFM said on Friday it planned to set up a new subsidiary to operate the Dairy Queen franchise. Brokers said the expected recovery of the consumer sector this year may have also boosted investor sentiment for Selecta. RFM Corp shares rose by 50 centavos, or 10.64 percent, to 5.20 pesos a share in midtrade but on low volumes. Some 24.35 million Selecta shares were traded at mid-session along with 978,000 RFM Corp shares. - Manila newsroom 63 2 8418939 fax 8176267
C12,CCAT,GCAT,GCRIM	 Dutch carrier KLM said on Monday it was considering whether to appeal against a court decision to throw out part of its lawsuit against a group of fellow shareholders in U.S. partner Northwest Airlines. &quot;KLM...is studying the advisability of appealing against part of the court decision,&quot; the airline said in a statement. KLM filed the suit in New York in November 1995 in a bid to undo amendments to a Northwest shareholders' agreement limiting its say in key corporate decisions. The two airlines have been locked in a boardroom battle for more than a year over what Northwest charges is KLM's bid to gain overall control of the U.S. airline. The 1995 amendments also reversed a proviso giving Northwest's original shareholders -- which include KLM, Alfred Checchi, Gary Wilson, Frederick Malek and Bankers Trust New York Corp -- first right of refusal over any Northwest shares offered for sale by the others. The New York Supreme Court on Friday dismissed KLM's claims on these points, saying the amendments had been passed by a majority of Northwest shareholders. However, the court said it would look into two other KLM claims relating to the appointment of Northwest board members and the U.S. airline's treatment of stock earmarked for acquisition by KLM under an option exercisable in 1998. &quot;KLM opposes the fact that the appointments procedure remains the preserve of a select group of people...in practice only the chairman of the (Northwest) board is empowered to appoint board members,&quot; KLM spokesman Pieter Wellhuner said. KLM further charges that the 5.27 million ordinary Northwest shares it stands to acquire through the exercise of its option should have been placed on separate deposit by its fellow Northwest shareholders. KLM on Monday welcomed the court's stance on these claims as &quot;a recognition of its principled standpoint that existing agreements should be honoured&quot;. Wellhuner said the New York court ruling would have no bearing on a separate suit brought by KLM against Northwest in Delaware, challenging Northwest's enactment of a 'poison pill' to cap KLM's voting rights. The poison pill makes it prohibitively expensive for any party to acquire more than 19 percent of Northwest shares, effectively killing off KLM's option to increase its Northwest voting stake from 18.8 percent to 23.4 percent in 1998. &quot;These are two entirely separate cases,&quot; Wellhuner said. KLM acquired the option to buy five percent of Northwest shares by lending its U.S. partner $250 million in 1992. In 1989, it contribute $400 million of the $700 million Checci and Wilson used to leverage a $3.6 billion buyout of Northwest. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040

GCAT,GPOL	 The excitement over Hong Kong's raucous farewell to its former British rulers ebbed, and optimism was laced with worry over emerging problems as the new administration actually began business under China. &quot;The party is over and now the real work begins,&quot; said a Sunday editorial in the Hong Kong Standard. Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong's sleep-deprived chief executive, barely had time to recover from all that smiling and handshaking on the night of June 30 and the early hours of July 1 before being literally swept up in a flood of problems. The sub-tropical Special Administrative Region (SAR) under China saw an extremely wet beginning, pelted with the worst rainstorms since records began in 1884. The rains injured eight, swept one elderly woman away, caused over 100 landslides and created nightmare traffic snarls. Facing a scrum of world media at his first news conference as head of the SAR, Tung behaved like a seasoned politician and gave away little on his policies. He merely hinted at making more land available for housing, but the uncertainty had an immediate impact. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended the first four days of the fledgling SAR at a sharply lower close, and property stocks were spooked by plans to curb rising real estate prices. The stock market had rocketed to all-time highs in the last week of British rule. Tung also danced around the question of elections for the legislature, noting simply that elections would be held in the second quarter of 1998. Law experts said he should not wait that long since the Basic Law, China's mini-constitution for Hong Kong, clearly said that SAR laws should be passed by an elected body. A barrister stood up in court on the SAR's first working day and said the legal system was unconstitutional under laws passed by the China-appointed Provisional Legislature. In a surprise initiative, Tung launched into talks with Taiwan and, by Thursday, each side had named a high-level intermediary to improve channels for cooperation. In one of the first visible signs that China would respect Hong Kong's autonomy, Beijing said on Friday it would not interfere in Hong Kong-Taiwan relations. China sees Taiwan as an arch-rival and renegade province. In a curt nod to transparency, the new government announced that the commander of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in Hong Kong, Major-General Liu Zhenwu, had paid a courtesy visit to the chief executive and had pledged to follow Hong Kong laws. This was not enough for pro-democracy activist Emily Lau, who doubted that Tung had the power to prevent a repeat of Beijing's 1989 Tiananmen Square, where PLA tanks crushed a pro-democracy movement, killing hundreds. &quot;If even (deposed Chinese Communist Party general secretary) Zhao Ziyang could not stop the massacre, how can we believe that Mr. Tung could,&quot; she stormed on government radio on Sunday. As the dignitaries rolled off in their limousines, there was a sense the world had abandoned the infant SAR in the woods. &quot;Of course most Hong Kong people are not so naive as to believe we can rely on foreign governments to look after us,&quot; Lau told government radio on Sunday. The influential South China Morning Post's Sunday editorial said the last governor Chris Patten had tried to &quot;get away&quot; with democratic reforms, rather like an architect building on ground that will soon belong to someone with different tastes. &quot;In time, the new owners duly take charge, and knock his building down as the architect departs, leaving the residents to rebuild a new structure,&quot; it concluded. But the watchdogs of freedom in Hong Kong were still at their posts and Democratic Party leader Martin Lee said he would keep an eye on the Provisional Legislature and trusted Tung to &quot;keep it honest.&quot;

E51,E512,ECAT	 Shanghai aims to double its foreign trade volume to $38 billion by the year 2000 from the 1995 level, with electrical and machinery products accounting for half its exports, a city official said on Thursday. The target for 2000 is $20 billion in exports and $18 billion in imports, up from actual $11.557 billion and $7.479 billion in 1995, the official who declined to be named, told a seminar. Shanghai has few resources and rising labour costs and must develop capital- and technology-intensive industries, such as the export of complete plant and equipment, he said. The share of Shanghai products in the national market is falling, with Shanghai firms facing the challenge of goods produced by rural enterprises, especially in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, he said. To meet this challenge, Shanghai firms are setting up franchise outlets to sell their goods nationwide and mounting exhibitions, the official said.
M13,M131,MCAT	 ----------------------- Nov 7 --------------------------- * Central Bank keeps overnight lending at 15.0 percent --------------------------------------------------------- Manila overnight money shot up to an average of 14.53125 percent on Thursday from 14 as banks aggressively borrowed to square their positions, traders said. &quot;They want to be avoid being penalized since it is nearly the end of the reserve week. They want to be square tomorrow,&quot; said a dealer from a large bank. Since the start of the week, banks had found it difficult to cover their reserve positions because of the long weekend.   Banks also had to grapple with reduced liquidity from tax remittances and the Central Bank's dollar sales last week. Rates zoomed to a high of 15.75 percent as banks with no collateral to back their borrowings from the Central Bank resorted to other banks, traders said. But near the end of Thursday's session, rates had started to ease near the day-low of 12 percent, one dealer said. Market volume swelled to 28.292 billion pesos from 21.560 billion pesos, with 29 borrowers and 36 lenders. The secondary market of T-bills continued to have many sellers and a few buyers, dealers said.

GCAT,GDIS,GWEA	 Rain-swelled rivers sent deadly floodwaters over their banks and hundreds of thousands of battered U.S. East Coast homes remained without electricity on Saturday as residents mopped up after Hurricane Fran. Rescue officials blamed the storm for at least 21 deaths in the Carolinas, Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Most of the deaths were caused by flash flooding and up to 15 inches (37.5 cm) of rain rather than Fran's gusts of wind that reached 120 mph (193 kmh) when the hurricane hit late on Thursday. Powerful tidal surges crumbled buildings along beaches and winds damaged neighbourhoods far inland before Fran was downgraded on Friday to a tropical storm as it entered Virginia. More than one million people in the Carolinas and Virginia remained without power on Saturday, officials said. North Carolina and Virginia were declared major disaster areas by U.S. President Bill Clinton, making victims eligible for federal assistance, although the cost of the damage will not be known for days. Damage in the Raleigh area alone was estimated at more than $930 million and officials privately hinted the statewide total could exceed $1 billion. In Raleigh, 4,000 homes were declared uninhabitable because of severe flooding. North Carolina Governor Jim Hunt ordered 1,000 National Guardsmen and 1,400 state prisoners to help clean up the damage. &quot;This is the worst storm we've had in a long, long time,&quot; he said. Two residents near Elkton, Virginia, were stranded in treetops on Friday for eight hours as flood waters rose -- and so were the two firefighters who tried to rescue them. All four were eventually plucked to safety by a helicopter. The remnants of Fran caused more misery on Saturday when it dumped more than six inches (15 cm) of rain on already saturated ground in Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania. North Carolina officials confirmed 15 deaths linked to the storm, mostly from traffic accidents and fallen trees. Among the fatalities was one of three Marines swept away by raging floodwaters at the height of the storm, the Wilmington Morning Star reported. Emergency workers found one of the two Marines who survived clutching the branches of a tree in six feet (1.8 metres) of water hours later.
E12,ECAT	 The following are excerpts from the question and answer session following the first leg of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins address before Congress. Greenspan addressed the Senate Banking Committee at 1000 EST/1500 GMT. SEN. SHELBY (R-AL): &quot;Why can't (the Labor Department) adjust that (CPI) on their own ... What can they do and what can't they do?&quot; GREENSPAN: &quot;My recollection is that the Boskin Report had about 0.6 of that 1.1 (percent) as quality adjustments ... Quality is very tough to measure. We often have have orders of magnitude, in other words we know that certain things are improving. &quot;We know for example that using the cost of physicians' input as a measure of output and level of health service is clearly inadequate because the quality of what we're getting in the medical profession is improving dramatically. &quot;Since all prices within the consumers price index are approximations, the argument that there's a certain necessary precision in this procedure is clearly false. What concerns me is that we presume that if we cannot get something exact that the best estimate is zero. &quot;I am arguing to do the professionally supportable thing, which is to put a number that has a higher probability of being right than zero.&quot; SEN. BENNETT (R-UTAH): &quot;Is it a possibility that (the business cycle's) swings are being dampened by the changes occurring in the economy as we move more from a manufacturing-based and industrial economy toward a service economy?&quot; GREENSPAN: &quot;There are two really important elements which generate the business cycle. One is inventories, and they are a surprisingly large factor in the change in GDP. &quot;We also have the issue of the level of structures of assets, in other words the amount of capital we have invested in plant and equipment and steel mills and electric utilities and the like, and the large stock of assets that exists in the household sector: houses, autos, appliances. &quot;To the extent that both of those stocks of inventories tend to fluctuate largely because we get ahead of ourselves and we have to adjust. What engenders the business cycle to a large extent has been the readjustment of the stock end of inventories. &quot;As we are going to increasing just-in-time inventories analysis and availability, we have clearly reduced the amplitude of the inventory fluctuation. It could be that that itself has fed into reducing the amplitude in the fluctuations in the growth property accounts in our system. &quot;It is a reasonable hypothesis that the shift has dampened the business cycle to a certain extent. I would be careful, however, to generalize that too far. To the extent that financial factors are an element in the fluctuations, there is no evidence that I am aware which has changed that type of environment.&quot; SEN. BENNETT: &quot;Let's talk about the CPI ... I wonder if the time has not (come) for us to abandon the notion of a single CPI. Would you comment about a CPI that varies by demographics and also regions?&quot; GREENSPAN: &quot;The (Bureau of Labor Statistics) does do several different types of CPIs. It has the old original one for wage-earners and then it has another one which it publishes side-by-side with urban consumers. &quot;It also has significant indexes for a whole slew of cities, but what it doesn't have is a difference in the levels. In other words, it has the rate of change in prices city by city so you can tell what the relative change has been, but you do not have data published on the level differences in the market basket which they are pricing. &quot;I think the answer to your question really depends on, what do we need it for? In the private sector there are innumerable re-estimations which are used very specifically for individual contracts. &quot;I used to construct a lot of them myself for clients. &quot;I would not argue for a fragmentation of these indexes and I would subscribe to the arguments the Boskin Commission made with respect to perhaps taking some of the resources that are being used for some of these regional indexes and employ it to improve the quality of the overall index. &quot;The issue of improving the quality of the two indexes we currently produce is probably a far greater priority than augmenting the number of indexes that we have.&quot; (( -- N.A.

GCAT,GDIP,GVIO	 The warring factions in the Congo Republic capital Brazzaville agreed on Friday to extend a truce for a further seven days as French troops pulled out of the city after evacuating foreign nationals. A spokesman for Brazzaville mayor and mediator Bernard Kolelas announced the extended truce, saying it would begin at midnight local time (2300 GMT) on Friday -- the time a 72-hour truce had been due to end. &quot;The chiefs of staff of both sides have agreed to prolong the ceasefire for a period of seven days starting tonight at midnight,&quot; the spokesman told Reuters in Kinshasa by telephone from Brazzaville. He was reading from a statement signed on behalf of supporters of President Pascal Lissouba, his rival former military president Denis Sassou Nguesso and Kolelas, whose own forces have so far kept out of any fighting. All three men had been due to contest a presidential election on July 27. Bloody ethnic and political clashes, which have killed hundreds of people if not more, have made parts of the capital of the oil-producing former French colony no-go areas. France's ambassador said French troops had left the city after evacuating almost 6,000 French and other foreign nationals. &quot;Yes, as far as I know they have all left,&quot; Ambassador Raymond Cesaire told Reuters in Kinshasa by telehpone from Brazzaville. He said 30 gendarmes remained in the city to protect French diplomats -- the ambassador and 12 other people. U.N. special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun and Congo's President Pascal Lissouba had urged France to leave its forces in the city beyond the expiry of the 72-hour ceasefire. Fighting broke out on June 5 after governmment soldiers surrounded the home of Sassou Nguesso as part of a crack-down on private militias and illegally held weapons in the run-up to the presidential poll.
GCAT,GCRIM	 Chinese police on Friday detained a man in Beijing's Tiananmen Square as he carried a wreath apparently dedicated to late patriarch Deng Xiaoping, witnesses said. Between 20 and 30 plainclothes police rushed up to the unidentified man as he walked from a subway entrance towards the Martyrs' Monument in the square. He was bundled into a car along with the wreath, on which the words &quot;Deng Xiaoping&quot; were written on a ribbon, a witness said. No further details were available on the incident, which was an indication of heightened security in the politically sensitive square following the death of China's paramount leader Deng on Wednesday evening. Tiananmen Square was the focus of huge student-led protests crushed by the military on June 4, 1989, in a crackdown ordered by Deng. A funeral ceremony for Deng is scheduled to be held in the Great Hall of the People next to the square on Tuesday.

GCAT,GPOL,GVOTE	 Buoyed by several new polls that show the presidential contest has narrowed, Republican Bob Dole campaigned through Ohio on Friday as a &quot;man of honour&quot; as he attacked President Bill Clinton on everything from taxes to foreign policy. Campaigning by bus for the second day in the big cities and picturesque farm towns of Ohio, Dole continued pushing his theme of being more trustworthy than Clinton. Reminding voters that Clinton did not deliver on a tax cut he promised in the 1992 campaign, Dole repeated his pledge to cut taxes by 15 percent and said, &quot;I am not Bill Clinton. I keep my word to the American people.&quot; Faulting Clinton's foreign policy in a speech on a college campus in Findlay, Dole said, &quot;We lost our respect overseas because of a lack of leadership.&quot; Former U.S. Education Secretary Bill Bennett, who has been quoted as urging Dole to attack Clinton more vigorously on the so-called character issue, appeared with Dole at a rally here and said he had always been known as a man of honour. &quot;It's been said about Bob Dole since he was a young man. It's not said about the other man running for president,&quot; Bennett said. Despite intense debate among Republicans about whether Dole should launch an all-out assault on Clinton's character, Dole has indicated repeatedly that he does not want to start mudslinging. Asked at a diner in Toledo if he was tired of being asked if he was tough enough, he replied, &quot;I'm tough.&quot; Of course, each time Dole does not take the bait when invited to attack Clinton, the character issue gets raised in the media without Dole risking being portrayed as a villain. &quot;They (American voters) knew all along about the continuing series of scandals that has plagued the Clinton administration for four year,&quot; Dole spokesman Nelson Warfield said. &quot;It's in the public psyche.&quot; Although all surveys show Dole still lagging Clinton, and some polls show a gap still in the double digits, Warfield said the Dole campaign had predicted the gap would narrow as election day approached. &quot;It's probably going to keep the other guys up at night,&quot; he said. A CNN/Gallup tracking poll showed the race tightening to 12 percentage points gap from 21 points mid-week. A tracking poll by the Political Hotline newsletter showed the race as tracking poll put the difference between Clinton and Dole at 9.7 percentage points on Friday. A Field poll in the largest electoral prize, California, showed Dole trailing by 10 points in that state, down from more than 20 points in other recent surveys. Ohio voted for Clinton in 1992 but victory here this year is crucial to Dole. Ohio's Republican Sen. Michael DeWine said the crowds along the bus route so far had been big and enthusiastic and he thought the race here was getting tighter. &quot;I sense a closure,&quot; DeWine said. Dole has seemed to enjoy himself on this trip, stopping at a small town bakery that boasts it makes the world's biggest pumpkin pie, standing in the shadow of grain silos or bathed in the light of the ferris wheel at a county fair. He has been very animated at some of the rallies, telling jokes out the microphone from the window of his bus, &quot;Asphalt One,&quot; a play on the presidential jet Air Force One. &quot;Don't forget to eat at the Monroe Street Diner ... See you at the inaugural,&quot; he told folks outside the Toledo diner.

C12,C181,GCRIM	 Norfolk Southern Corp. Friday filed an appeal of lower-court rulings against its attempts to block the planned merger of rival railroad companies Conrail Inc. and CSX Corp.. The appeal asked the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia for a decision ahead of a crucial Conrail shareholders meeting next Friday, or to block the meeting pending a decision. Conrail is based in Philadelphia. The appeal contested Thursday's rulings by U.S. District Judge Donald Van Artsdalen against Norfolk, Va.-based Norfolk Southern, which analysts said increased the prospects CSX would win the bitter and costly takeover battle. Van Artsdalen, also in Philadelphia, denied a Norfolk Southern request for a preliminary injunction against a two-year &quot;no-shop&quot; provision in the CSX-Conrail merger agreement, which prevents Conrail from considering another offer until 1999. He also rejected Norfolk Southern's argument that Conrail and CSX of Richmond, Va., triggered a Pennsylvania law that would require CSX to pay all cash for Conrail shares. And he declined to block the Jan. 17 Conrail shareholders meeting until a final legal decision on the issue could be rendered. At the meeting, shareholders will be asked to waive the Pennsylvania law, which requires that a company acquiring 20 percent or more of the shares in another company must pay &quot;fair value&quot; -- essentially, equivalent terms -- for all the other shares. Approval of the waiver would allow CSX to close on a $110 per-share cash tender offer on Jan. 22, raising its stake in Conrail to 40 percent from 19.9 percent. At that point, approval of the $9.1 billion merger proposal by Conrail shareholders would be certain because CSX also holds an option on a 15 percent Conrail stake, large enough to give it majority control. CSX intends to swap shares for the remaining 60 percent of Conrail. Norfolk Southern, pursuing a rival $10.3 billion bid for Conrail, said in its appeal that Van Artsdalen had erred on both the &quot;no-shop&quot; and &quot;fair value&quot; issues. It said the two-year &quot;no-shop&quot; provision would unfairly coerce Conrail shareholders into voting for the CSX deal next week without being able to seriously weigh the Norfolk Southern offer. Norfolk Southern said Conrail's board violated its fiduciary duties in agreeing to the provision. &quot;If defendants are permitted to go forward, the CSX merger will go forward without Conrail's shareholders ever having exercised free choice on the matter,&quot; Norfolk Southern said. It also said Conrail shareholders had the right to know before they voted whether they were already entitled to receive $110 a share cash for all of their shares under the fair value provision. The appeal asks the court to order Conrail and CSX to reply to the appeal by Monday. Conrail stock rose 75 cents to $100.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
M11,MCAT	 A small rebound among Czech major issues petered out on Tuesday pulling the PX50 index lower for the ninth straight session. The PX50 lost 2.2 points to 501.6 while the major issue dominated RPIX declined seven points to 1,033. The most heavily capitalised Czech issue, SPT Telecom lost 17 crowns to 2,868 while the bourse's second biggest share, power utility CEZ, fell 15 crowns to 965. Traders said the continuing downtrend in the Czech equities market was unlikely to end in the near future adding that the Prague bourse was likely to lose out to neighbouring countries when region-wide buying fatigue finally comes to an end. &quot;The Czech Republic is suffering from apathy and (in this respect) is trading in line with the rest of the region,&quot; said Jay King of Wood &amp; Company in Prague. &quot;What's going to continue to differentiate the market here...is the (presence of) privatisation elsewhere for example Poland. Prague will lag because of the lack of new issues,&quot; he added. The Czech Republic privatised most of the economy in a mass voucher-for-shares programme, which was completed early in 1995. The state still holds tens of billions of crowns worth of assets but most are held in banks and politically sensitive strategic companies. Added to this, the centre-right government lost its majority in May/June elections and depends on the Social Democrats for parliamentary support which makes sensitive privatisation projects a complicated affair. By contrast, the Polish government, which took a different approach to de-nationalisation, aims to sell 115 companies directly to investors, and float at least five firms on the Warsaw bourse, next year including the giant KGHM Polska Miedz copper concern and a partial sell-off of Bank Handlowy SA. Also planned for 1997 is a partial privatisation of the national air carrier LOT as well as the start of the process at telecommunications monopolist TPSA, several oil refineries and the energy sector. Apart from the relative dearth of flotations in the Czech Republic, the Prague bourse is widely criticised for its lack of transaparency and inadequate protection for minority share holders, in which respects its is generally considered inferior to other leading post-communist reformers.
M13,M132,MCAT	 The Indonesian rupiah fell against the dollar in moderate early trading on Wednesday on the back of ample money supply, dealers said. They said excess rupiah supply triggered off some dollar buying, aided by the underlying concern over the on-going election campaign lasting till May 23 for the May 29 poll. &quot;It's mainly the liquidity which is driving the dollar up,&quot; one local bank dealer said. Spot rupiah was at 2,430.5/31.5 at 0210 GMT, compared with an opening of 2,426.5/27.5. Tomorrow and today rupiah were at 2,430.65/31.15 and 2,430.20/30.70, respectively.   One dealer in Singapore said a public holiday there on Thursday also sparked off a slew of short dollar covering. &quot;People here don't want to go home with open positions.&quot; &quot;I think it's also mainly liquidity-driven. If people are pulling out from short dollar outright positions, forwards would have also been taken,&quot; the dealer said. He said stop-loss buying had triggered the dollar to touch a high of 2,432.0 after the spot rate broke through the 2,430.0 stop-loss level in the morning. The dealer said expectations that there would be no band widening in the near-term might be the other reason.

GCAT,GDIP,GPOL	 Israel and the PLO resumed talks on Friday at Egypt's Red Sea resort of Taba on a long- delayed Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron. Talks on Thursday had gone into the night with negotiators on both sides voicing optimism but they adjourned before dawn after a setback. PLO officials said the talks ran aground when differences developed among Israel's team. In Hebron itself about 100 Jewish settler women and children briefly blocked the gate to Israeli occupation headquarters in the town. &quot;The redeployment of the army will endanger not only the 400 Jews in Hebron but all of Israel,&quot; settler Nadia Matar told reporters. Palestinian delegates had looked angry as they left the earlier meeting held in Israel's Eilat but Israeli spokesman Moshe Fogel said progress had been made. U.S. envoy Dennis Ross, who is mediating the talks, said: &quot;They have narrowed the differences. They're working hard but there are still differences to be overcome.&quot; &quot;We came to Eilat with an agreement to start drafting a protocol on a Hebron deal after the major issues were resolved earlier,&quot; said a PLO (Palestine Liberation Organisation) official, who asked not to be identified. &quot;However, internal disputes of the Israeli delegation prevented any progress. They wanted the meetings to be postponed until next week,&quot; he added. Palestinian officials said the differences were between the Israeli political and military representatives. Before the Eilat meeting, the Palestinians had said a deal on Hebron could be signed on Friday or Sunday and start coming into force 10 days later. A Palestinian official said major stumbling blocks were removed during a Thursday meeting between Israeli army chief Amnon Shahak, PLO negotiator Abu Mazen, Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo and Ross. Palestinian officials said Israel was no longer insisting on establishing a buffer zone or on the right to hot pursuit of wanted Palestinians in areas of Hebron coming under PLO control. They said it was also agreed that talks on all other outstanding issues in a 1995 interim deal signed with Israel's previous government would start immediately after a Hebron agreement. These issues would include further redeployments and the release of Palestinian prisoners. But Israeli media, quoting sources on the Israeli team, on Friday said far from dropping the hot pursuit demand the sides were working on a compromise in which a joint PLO-Israeli force would carry out hot pursuit. Israel's Haaretz daily, quoting a senior source on the Israeli team, said the proposal had been brought to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and that he approved it. Palestinian negotiators denied the reports. The redeployment, due to have taken place in March, was delayed by Islamic suicide bombings in Israel and later put off by Netanyahu, elected in May, who said changes were needed to enhance security for some 400 Jewish settlers living amidst 100,000 Palestinians in Hebron. Netanyahu's office declined comment on a report on Thursday that a secret message from Syria could enable their long-stalled peace talks to resume. A spokeswoman would not comment on the Israel Channel Two report that Netanyahu's political adviser Dore Gold secretly met U.S. diplomat Edward Djerejian who was returning from a meeting with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in Damascus.

The Russian straight run sector was also suffering from muted interest with E-4 assessed around the mid $120s cif.
E21,E212,E51,ECAT,G15,G154,G158,GCAT	 The European Commission approved 250 million European Currency Units balance of payments support for Bulgaria for up to ten years, the EC said in a statement. The assistance would complement resources being provided by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and bilateral donors in the context of Bulgaria's stabilisation and structural adjustment programme for 1997/1998, said the statement. The purpose of the assistance is to secure the external funding needed to ensure adequate support for the government's economic reform programme, which is being implemented in a particularly difficult economic environment, said the EC. The Commission believed Bulgaria is beginning to emerge from its severe economic and social difficulties, said the statement. Bulgaria's parliament appointed last week a reform-minded government led by leader of the Union of Democratic Forces Ivan Kostov. The interim cabinet, which stepped down last week after three months in office curbed inflation and stabilised the exchange rate. Introducing an IMF-prescribed currency board system in July, which is a restrictive fixed exchange rate regime designed to stabilise the country's shaky banks and volatile currency is one of the cabinet's first tasks. Bulgaria sealed a $657 million reform and funding agreement with the IMF last month and the World Bank has earmarked a $290 million funding package if the government speeds up privatisation of state factories and banks and eliminates public sector losses. The EU assistance would be released in two instalments subject to a satisfactory track record in economic stabilisation and progress with structural reforms. -- Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-981-4145

Volume was lively at 80 million markka. &quot;UPM indicated that the worst is probably over for the forest industry,&quot; a broker said, adding he still saw upside in the share. But another broker said new record-highs could prompt profit-taking and take the share lower. Mainly overseas investors were buying UPM shares, operators said. UPM on Tuesday reported 1996 profit before extraordinary items down to 3.56 billion markka from 6.3 billion, but said there was scope for higher 1997 earnings. -- Helsinki newsroom +358-9-6805 0248, news@reuters.fi

GCAT,GDIP	 British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind met his Argentine counterpart Guido Di Tella on Friday, a British Foreign Office spokesman said, but he would not reveal what had been on the agenda. The spokesman said the two met at Rifkind's official country residence in Chevening, near Sevenoaks, southeast England, and that further talks were planned for Saturday. A spokesman for the Argentine Foreign Ministry said Di Tella, under fire for policy on the disputed Falkland Islands, had wanted to keep the visit quiet. &quot;We would have liked to handle this more discreetly, but it got out somehow without the Foreign Ministry's blessing,&quot; he said. Neither British nor Argentine officials would say exactly what the two ministers were discussing. A British embassy spokesman described the meeting as informal talks on U.K.-Argentine relations and stressed: &quot;No change to British sovereignty over the Falklands will be discussed. We are not offering or prepared to transfer or share sovereignty.&quot; The Foreign Official official in London said the Falklands were bound to crop up during the talks, but he too insisted that the question of sovereignty was not up for discussion. Argentina and Britain fought a brief but bloody war over the remote South Atlantic islands in 1982 in which about 1,000 soldiers, mostly Argentine, died. Argentina lost the war but maintains its claim to the islands, which it calls the Malvinas and says were &quot;usurped&quot; by Britain in 1833. Britain keeps a garrison there and refuses to discuss sovereignty. But since Peronist Argentine President Carlos Menem came to power in 1989, he has resumed diplomatic ties, hosted visits by British royals and forged close trade links, while insisting he will win back the islands by the year 2000. Di Tella has received flak for a charm offensive that has included sending islanders Christmas cards, books and videos. He recently admitted he has won little ground, then changed tack to claim he has secured a radical change in attitude among the islanders and managed to make the British nervous. He also said a deal with Britain on oil exploration in the South Atlantic signed last year was &quot;the biggest advance in 170 years&quot; of territorial dispute.

C13,CCAT,GCAT,GDIS	 India will make it compulsory from 1998 for all imported aircraft to be fitted with a safety device to help avoid mid-air collisions, Civil Aviation Minister C.M. Ibrahim said on Friday. Ibrahim told the Indian parliament the Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS), which functions independently of the ground traffic system, alerted pilots when two aircraft were &quot;dangerously close&quot;. The system gives audio and visual warnings and also advises the crew on corrective action needed to avoid a collision, he said in a statement. At least 349 people were killed when a Saudi Arabia Airlines Boeing 747 and a Kazakh Ilyushin Il-76 freighter collided about 80 km (50 miles) west of New Delhi on November 12, in the world's worst ever mid-air collision. Ibrahim said air traffic services and associated facilities were being upgraded and modernised by the Airports Authority of India but it would take time to cover all Indian airspace. He said ACAS had been made mandatory for all aircraft with a seating capacity of more than 30 passengers or payload capacity of more than three tonnes for cargo aircraft, with effect from the beginning of 1999. Installation of ACAS had also been made mandatory on transport aircraft of less than 30 seats, tentatively after December 31, 2001. Ibrahim said he had met with leading financial institutions and commercial banks to formalise a long-term policy to finance buying of aircraft, maintenence and training.

C21,CCAT,GCAT,GENT	 At first glance one might be forgiven for taking &quot;The Book That's Sweeping America&quot; as yet another bland management tome bristling with business babble and evangelical slogans. Such books are a dime a dozen, and if they fail to reach the bestseller lists they may at least achieve cult status or a place on the bookshelf (usually unread). This book, cunningly written under the nom de plume Stephen Michael Peter Thomas, is published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., the bluest of blue-chip business publishers and purveyors of such self-congratulatory bestsellers as &quot;Warren Buffett's Way&quot;, &quot;Soros on Soros&quot; and &quot;Bloomberg by Bloomberg&quot;. The cover picture of the smartly tailored &quot;author,&quot; languidly perched upside down in a leather easy chair, is just the sort of thing one might expect from a Lee Iacocca, or a Michael Ovitz -- or Bloomberg or Soros for that matter. The book's core theoretical &quot;learnings&quot; -- leadership is hard; communication is important; change is different; people are human, the future is tomorrow -- are only marginally more outrageous than some of the blindingly obvious claptrap that passes for serious wisdom uttered by management consultants and many of today's CEOs. There are many bad writers churning out serious management books. Fortunately &quot;The Book That's Sweeping America&quot; is not at all serious. The real author, Boston-based consultant John Butman, is a very funny writer running riot with his subject. Suggested management training courses include joining a bomb disposal squad, changing a car tire at 80 miles an hour, taking charge of a &quot;big ship&quot; (preferably an oil tanker) as it hurtles toward a reef, and the intriguingly titled &quot;Roll the Product Marshmallow across the Hot Coals of Development&quot;. This exercise exhorts executives to push a marshmallow across a bed of white-hot coals using their noses. To make it more challenging, the author suggests, &quot;team members should be stripped naked, blindfolded, and lashed together with a high-speed, fire-resistant T-3 data cable.&quot; Such merciless spoofs of management games accompany reckless swipes at business jargon, organisational structure and some sage advice on creating a &quot;humorless workplace&quot; and &quot;gender-neutral clothing guidelines.&quot; Having created corporate images for such gigantic concerns as Gillette Co. and written speeches for captains of industry such as the late great An Wang and Reebok International Ltd Chief Executive Officer Paul Fireman, Butman is familiar with the top echelons of business. His vignette of meeting &quot;faith-based finance&quot; guru Dr. Vree Patchouk (apparently loosely modelled on Deepak Chopra) at his English country pile, is hysterical. Take the following gem: &quot;With little effort, I could hear the sound of a butler polishing priceless Asprey silver in the dining room adjacent. I could hear the voices of workmen as they pulled a high-speed ISDN line through the 18th century walls to improve Internet response time ... the first thought that came to mind was 'I wonder how much money this guy makes a year?'&quot; Like all good satire, &quot;The Book That's Sweeping America&quot; taps into some powerful realities. It will appeal to the disaffected of the business world in much the same way the cartoon strip &quot;Dilbert&quot; strikes a chord with anyone who has been senselessly trampled by management. Yet Wiley, the publisher, is clearly cautious about biting the hand that feeds it. In searching for the desirable crossover market -- between the business book reader and mass market book buyer -- it has marketed the book by creating a whole persona around the fictional author Stephen Michael Peter Thomas. While this is amusing, particularly at bookstore signings, it is also confusing. Some reviewers immediately get it, while others have not responded well. &quot;A strangely unfunny April Fools Day spoof,&quot; huffed one reviewer in London's Financial Times.
M14,M141,MCAT	 FCOJ futures ended sharply down in a technical correction to recent gains, traders said. Prices rose early amid local buying in an attempt to push July through resistance and continue the recent uptrend. Failing to reach its overhead target of 80.00 cents, prices retreated as disappointed locals sold, and the trade emerged as a scale-up seller, floor sources said. The market drifted barely over unchanged until selling became more aggressive and the light buying dried up, just ahead of the close. The July contract settled 2.00 cents lower at 77.00 cents per lb, having ranged from 79.90 to 76.40 cents. September finished down 2.05 at 81.50 cents, and the outer contracts closed 1.00 to 0.25 lower. The market continues to ignore reports of an outbreak of the citrus canker in Florida, and fears that the Medfly could move to the state's citrus-growing region after remaining confined to the areas east of Tampa. Florida state agriculture officials said an aerial spraying program launched last week has failed to eradicate the pests, and that it has expanded the initial spray zone from 50 square miles to 120 square miles. &quot;In spite of the (insect) news, the market is not doing much,&quot; Celeste Georgakis, vice president with Dean Witter, said. Industry sources said the insects do not pose a serious threat to the crop at the end of harvest. &quot;So far, the infestation seems to be contained and players are not worried,&quot; Georgakis said. At the same time, the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed that Florida would produce a record crop of 224.2 million 90-lb boxes, unchanged from its last estimate. The monthly report also left yields unchanged at 1.58 gallons per box. Volume was estimated at 3,000 lots, compared with Wednesday's official 2,454 lots.

M14,M143,MCAT	 U.S. spot Group Three gasoline differentials eased a half cent late Monday in sympathy with weak Chicago prices, players said, with absolute prices further depressed by a sharp decline in NYMEX futures. &quot;Wet barrels are making their way to the Group&quot; from Chicago, one trader said, noting that Chicago barrels had been selling in the morning for 9.0 cents below the April print -- versus 2.0 cents under for Group material. That seven-cent spread narrowed by one cent by late Monday, players said, as Group traders came out shopping for the relatively cheap Chicago fuel.   &quot;You can drive a long way for six cents (a gallon), and trucks are on their wway,&quot; one player said. Chicago conventional unleaded was pegged late day at 8.50 cents below the screen, edging differentially higher on the serendipitous Group buying. But Group material was talked as low as three cents below the screen. Chicago gasoline diffs are expected to remain under pressure, however, amid a continued selloff of winter-grade fuel. The switch to nine-pound square inch Reid vapor pressure material from 13.5-pound winter grade is slated for the end of the month. - ((New York Energy Desk, 212 859-1620))

GCAT,GDEF,GDIP	 Brazilian diplomat Jose Mauricio Bustani has been elected as the first director-general of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the OPCW said on Wednesday. The OPCW's mission is to enforce a treaty imposing a global ban on the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons which entered into force on April 29. Bustani, 51, was elected by delegates attending a three-week inaugural conference of the organisation in the Hague which began on May 6. A total of 88 countries have now ratified the treaty and are allowed to vote on key matters such as OPCW's budget and office-holders, while a further 77 countries which have signed the treaty but not yet ratified it could send non-voting observers. The observer countries include Russia, whose parliament has postponed approval of the treaty, despite pressure from President Boris Yeltsin, arguing Russia needs more time and Western financial aid to destroy its weapons. Russia and the United States, which ratified the treaty in April just ahead of the deadline for doing so, are the two biggest holders of chemical weapons, with combined stocks of some 70,000 tonnes. Bustani, a seasoned diplomat with 31 years in Brazil's foreign service, was since 1994 the head of the disarmament and non-proliferation department in the Brazilian Foreign Ministry. He was promoted to the diplomatic rank of Ambassador in 1995. Prabhakar Menon of India was elected as the first chairman of the OPCW's 41-member Executive Council, which will oversee its day-to-day functioning, the agency said. The Chemical Weapons Convention requires all signatories to destroy their chemical weapons within 10 years and provide detailed information about production and export of listed chemicals which could be used to make them. They must also open their chemicals complexes to the OPCW for both regular and short-notice inspections. The agency has been training a multinational force of over 140 munitions specialists, analytical and industrial chemists and production experts as inspectors since January and they are expected to begin verifications soon.
C21,CCAT,E61,ECAT	 Construction starts on new homes and apartments in September posted their biggest drop in 21 months, falling to the lowest level since last December, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Housing starts fell 6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.438 million. That was below Wall Street economist forecasts for a 1.47-million-unit building rate.   The September drop was the largest since January 1995, when there was a 9 percent decline, the Commerce Department said. The September level was the lowest since last December, when housing starts reached an annual rate of 1.425 million units. The September drop came after construction starts in August had reached the highest level in about 2-1/2 years, initially reported at an annual rate of 1.525 million units and now revised up to an annual rate of 1.529 million. July housing starts were revised upward to a 1.47 million annual rate from 1.46 million reported previously. Construction starts on new single-family homes fell 8.9 percent in September to a rate of 1.122 million a year. It was the biggest drop since January 1995, when there was a 12 percent decline, the Commerce Department said. Building of apartments rose in September by 6.4 percent to an annual rate of 316,000, after a 7.2 percent drop in August. On Wednesday, the National Association of Home Builders reported a fifth consecutive monthly drop in its index of housing market activity during October. Builders said buyer interest was subsiding after a very strong spring and early summer but remained at healthy levels. Mortgage rates edged up last month. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said rates for a 30-year loan averaged 8.23 percent in September, up from 8 percent in August. Regionally, housing starts rose 1.4 percent in the Northeast to a 140,000 annual rate, which was the highest level since November 1994, when it was 169,000, the department said. Starts declined in the three other regions by 10.4 percent in the Midwest, 0.9 percent in the South and 13.3 percent in the West. Applications for new building permits fell 2.9 percent in September to a rate of 1.382 million.

C15,C152,CCAT	 Moovies Inc said Monday third quarter net income should be $0.04 to $0.07 per share, below earlier expectations, due primarily to lower than anticipated revenues in the last six weeks of the quarter. Also, the company said, its videotape purchases were based on expected demand resulting in higher than anticipated store operating expenses as a percentage of revenues for the quarter. &quot;While actual results will not be reported until November, we believe that earnings per share for the quarter will be in the range of $0.04 to $0.07,&quot; it said.   This &quot;is substantially less than the analysts' estimates for the quarter,&quot; Moovies stated, without providing those estimates. Chief executive John Taylor said &quot;The company's revenues were in accordance with our expectations through the middle of August; however, anticipated post-Olympics same-store revenue increases did not materialize.&quot; Taylor continued, &quot;While the majority of our stores are posting strong revenue results, several of our locations, including a group of stores in Georgia, have not performed in line with our expectations. In addition, revenues from stores opened less than a year have been lower than anticipated, primarily due to delays in the opening schedule. In closing, Taylor said, &quot;During the quarter ended September 30, 1996, in accordance with our stated objective, we opened 18 new stores and are on track to meet our stated objective of 50 new stores opened in 1996.&quot; Moovies currently operates 203 video specialty stores in 16 states. -- New York Newsdesk 212-859-1610
C13,C24,CCAT,GCAT,GPOL	 The head of a House subcommittee on transportation on Thursday accused Federal Aviation Administration staff members of lying to Congress on a project to consolidate the control facilities of the three Washington-area airports. Rep Frank Wolf, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee's transportation subcommittee, said FAA staff lied when they told the committee that the proposed &quot;Potomac Project&quot; was not cost-effective. &quot;There was a planned strategy down there, you can see it, to mislead Congress,&quot; the Virginia Republican said. Wolf said internal FAA reports show the &quot;metroplex&quot; facility in the Washington area would improve safety, provide more than $500 million in benefits and has a benefit-cost ratio of about 20 to one. &quot;The FAA has turned away from this proposal because one office in headquarters wanted to make their own reality,&quot; Wolf said. An FAA spokesman said the matter was referred to the Department of Transportation's Inspector General as soon as Wolf brought it to the FAA's attention. Wolf said he would take up the issue up with President Clinton's nominee to head the FAA, Jane Garvey.

GCAT,GVIO	 Israel rounded up another 51 West Bank  Palestinians on Friday in a crackdown on Islamic militant groups it  said may have launched the suicide attack which ravaged Jerusalem's  main Jewish market. &quot;Since our working assumptions are that Hamas or Islamic Jihad stand  behind this attack, we are arresting whatever in an investigation  can help us solve the attack,&quot; the army chief, Lieutenant-General  Amnon Shahak, told reporters. Israeli and Palestinian forces have both made arrests -- each in areas  under its security control -- since Wednesday's attack killed the  two bombers and 13 people ranging in age from 15 to 92. The Israeli army said it had rounded up 79 Palestinians in all since  the bombing. While Israel continued to bury its dead, its army said troops were  questioning suspects about possible involvement in &quot;hostile terrorist  activity&quot;. Troops also seized suspected anti-Israeli propaganda. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suspended peace talks and  an aide said on Thursday that Israel could re-enter areas handed over  to the Palestinians to seize &quot;terrorists&quot; if President Yasser Arafat  failed to do the job. Jerusalem police commander Yair Yitzhaki said his forces were tightening  security in the city for fear of another attack. Moslem militants  have in the past carried out a series of suicide bombings over several  days. Israeli officials on Thursday meanwhile questioned the authenticity  of a leaflet issued in the name of Hamas, which like Islamic Jihad  opposes Arafat's peace moves with Israel. The leaflet, faxed to an international news agency, claimed responsibility  and gave Israel until 9 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Sunday to free all Palestinian  prisoners. A Hamas leaflet issued on Friday praised the attack and hailed resistance  as the only way to liberate the land. But it did not claim responsibility  or repeat the ultimatum. It called the attack &quot;a practical response to the hostile Zionist  practices against our people and our nation which has witnessed a  noticeable escalation siince the terrorist Netanyahu came to office  in the Zionist entity&quot;. Police eliminated suspicions that the bombers were two young men missing  for 14 months from their homes in the West Bank village of Dahariyeh.  Genetic tests on relatives showed they were not the attackers, police  said. Despite a collapse in Israeli-Palestinian peace moves, the Israeli  army chief said the two sides were engaged in security &quot;coordination  of various sorts&quot; to try to crack the case. In Gaza, Palestinian forces released two senior Hamas political leaders  after questioning them for three hours. A Palestinian official said a meeting of Israeli and PLO officers  on Thursday night had cleared the way for an easing of a closure that  Israel clamped on the West Bank and Gaza Strip barring Arabs from  entering the Jewish state. The army said entry would be allowed in medical emergencies and for  medical personnel in Arab East Jerusalem. Speaking at an Israeli army position in the West Bank, General Shahak  told reporters he did not care that Arafat, through his advisers,  had blasted the Israeli measures. &quot;What do I care what Arafat says? I believe it's very important that  the Palestinian Authority does what it can to fight -- and it can  fight -- the Palestinian terrorism coming from the territories under  its responsibility,&quot; Shahak said. &quot;If this responsibility won't be realised, there's no doubt that we  don't rely on anyone but ourselves and we have the ability and we  make use of it.&quot; In a Reuters interview on Thursday, Netanyahu accused Arafat of having  done &quot;damn all&quot; to tackle violence and said the international community  had an obligation to demand action from the Palestinian leader. Arafat's aides called Israeli moves a &quot;declaration of war&quot; and said  they would only crush Palestinian hopes of peace. Wednesday's attack deepened a four-month peace crisis sparked in March  when Netanyahu broke ground on a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
E12,ECAT	 The usual round of October general rates increases look unlikely as carriers remain reticent to push the rates up. Next April looks to be the preferred month for any inceases, a Reuter survey showed. An All Nippon Airlines spokesman said the rates would remain stable, adding the market is 'not quite ready'. April next year may be the time ANA looks for an increase, he added. Korean Airlines cargo manager, Frank Smith, said he is extremely cautious about any autumn increases, adding that April looks more likely. A spokesman from leading freight forwarder, MSAS, Doug Overett, was more adamant about the prospect of rates rises. &quot;Many think the market could not take any rates rises, it is not a strong enough market to squeeze any more from&quot;, he added. Ray Disson, UK cargo manager of Emirates Airline, said the carrier will probably not increase rates to Dubai in October because Emirates had increased rates on the route for the last three years. Some carriers have bucked the trend, American Airlines has put increases in place and German carrier Lufthansa is considering some increases. John Smith, UK cargo manager of American Airlines, added that a five percent increase had been added to all routes. Demand is very strong, he said, &quot;we would not put prices up unless we were confident&quot;. Lufthansa's UK marketing manager, Ruediger Helm, said Lufthansa has increased its &quot;Flash' express tariffs by six to seven percent on August 1. But as regards general cargo he added, &quot;we are evaluating rates increases but a dramatic increase would not be right'. After the first quarter of the year activity levelled off a little, he said. Most carriers claim to be looking for stability in the market. United Airlines UK cargo manager, Peter Chase, said United is another carrier preferring to take a more cautious approach to rates rises. However, he commented, United reviews rates twice a year and would prefer to see stability in the market. &quot;We would prefer to create a stable base from which people can operate and we would actually prefer to look at the rates once a year and retain them on an annual basis.&quot; Concerning market activity, most report that September has seen a pick-up as the summer season draws to a close and people return to work. But in all markets, the condition cannot be described as booming, though most say it is in line with their expectations. Barry Gibson of Singapore Airlines (SIA) said so far business to Asia is positive, following the usual August slown-down because of the holidays and factory closures. SIA had quite severe payload restrictions because of high passenger loads and weather conditions in the summer, he said. Already the airline is able to carry around five tons per flight more than it could in the summer, he said. SIA is another carrier that will not be introducing increases, it too is looking to next April for rises,he said. Business to north east Asia seems to have shown the biggest pick-up in business. An ANA spokesman said the Japanese carrier already had all of its space booked on Monday for the following weekend and the outlook was good for the coming weeks. From the UK he was confident the carrier would be above budget, he added. He put the upturn in business volumes down to the UK's favourable exchange rate. But he admitted business inbound from Japan was not quite so buoyant. Korean Airlines in the UK was even more optimistic.Frank Smith, UK cargo manager said September was in line with expectations and the airline was ahead of this time last year. He added that he was way above budget. He added that despite the busy market he too remains very cautious about any rates rises because the European Continent is not as buoyant as the UK market. Rates have remained exceptionally stable to the Asian market, showing little signs of changing. Rates to Korea and Australia have edged up slightly to 1.83 stg and 2.05 stg a kg respectively. Most air cargo players operating in the UK-U.S. market have looked forward to the return of winter schedules as summer charters travelling to popular holiday destinations have created a glut of capacity on certain routes. Kevin Durnin of Viking Freight, representative of Leisure International Airways, said outbound business is difficult especially because of the competition generated because of holiday traffic. Rates have been dumped, market sources said, especially to destinations such as Orlando and Atlanta during the summer. One shipper requested a 0.35 a kg rate on a 6.5 ton shipment to Atlanta, said one source. However, John Smith, cargo manager of American Airlines, said he felt confident enough in the market and for that reason the carrier had implemented rates rises. Demand has remained strong to the U.S., he said, though competition on price and quality has remained tough. United Airlines Peter Chase said there are signs of an upward trend this month, although it has not been as rapid as the carrier would have liked, he admitted. He said that business was not quite as good as last year although he admitted, 1995 was an exceptional year for many. Last year, manufacturers went through a re-stocking programme, he said. Chase added that he expects the fourth quarter to be reasonable but not the boom it was in 1995. U.S. rates are fairly stable even though a lot of spot-rate activity has being taking place. Rates to Los Angeles have fallen to 0.69 from 0.71 per kg and New York has gone up slightly from 0.60 to 0.61 per kg. In the Middle East market ex-UK, carriers say September has seen a &quot;small pick-up'. A Gulf Air spokesman said activity has increased slightly and that he is expecting a stable fourth quarter. Disson of Emirates said this year is as good as last year. However, there is more spot-rate activity in the market this month, with even the larger carriers getting involved in some very competitive pricing, he said. Africa is again generating a lot of interest in the market in the UK as German carrier Lufthansa introduces a weekly DC8 freighter from London Gatwick to Nairobi and Virgin Atlantic prepares to launch its South African service. Lufthansa's Helm said Africa is an interesting market and not only for the perishables industry. Semi-finished and finished goods are increasing traffic to Africa, he added. People are buying more in Africa and there is much more confidence in southern Africa, especially, which has led more companies to set up production plants in the country, he said. Latin America demand remains strong, with airline's travelling at full capacity. Paul Ryan, of Varig Brazilian Airways, said Sao Paulo and Rio are full. Shipments for the many automobile manufacturers based in Brazil are generating a lot of business, he said. Rates to Sao Paulo remain strong and are showing an upward swing to 2.06 stg a kg.
GCAT,GPOL	 Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori's public approval rating dipped to 52.3 percent at the beginning of October, from 54.3 percent a month before, a leading pollster said Sunday. The survey of 400 Peruvians by Analistas y Consultores also showed that 39.3 percent dissaproved of Fujimori's record, while 8.5 percent had no opinion. Fujimori, who took office in 1990 and won reelection last year with an overwhelming 64 percent of the vote, has had relatively high popularity ratings during his term due primarily to the virtual defeat of communist guerrillas, economic reforms and his strong, personalized leadership style. But his perceived authoritarianism and the administration's failure to reduce high levels of poverty and unemployment is starting to take its toll on Fujimori's popularity, analysts say. -- Renzo Pipoli, Lima newsroom, 511 221-2134

GCAT,GDIP	 The United Nations opened a new combined centre for several of its agencies in Copenhagen on Monday, and added a new purchasing office with an annual budget of 500 million Danish crowns ($85 million). The new U.N. centre houses three of the world body's agencies -- IAPSO, the purchasing organ for the United Nations Development Programme, UNOPS, the office for project services and FAO/EASTFISH, a UN Food &amp; Agricultural Organisation project, the Danish Foreign ministry said. It said total U.N. staff in Copenhagen would be increased by 40 from just under the 600 presently employed. New York-based UNOPS, which buys goods and services for development projects, opens a Copenhagen purchasing office with a 500 million crown budget and staff of 30. UNDP and IAPSO are already operating in Copenhagen, as is its children's agency UNICEF and WHO, the World Health Organisation, which has its European regional headquarters in the Danish capital.

M14,M141,M142,M143,MCAT	 On overnight commodity markets, the big mover was the gold price, which jumped US$5 an ounce after the South African Central Bank governor said he did not expect central banks to sell much more gold. Copper edged lower in London and New York after its rally of recent days, while wheat prices firmed on fund buying in Chicago and a rally in corn. Oil prices edged lower on news of growing crude supply. The CRB Index was down 0.03 of a point at 241.35 at 8.00 a.m. Australian time. METALS LME copper nervously oscillated in a narrow band on Thursday afternoon, ending marginally softer ahead of stocks data on Friday. &quot;Copper seems to have run out of steam,&quot; said analyst William Adams of broker Rudolf Wolff, adding that producer forward selling and buying of puts had been seen. Three months copper ended the afternoon kerb $12 weaker at $2,328 per tonne after earlier nudging the upside above $2,350. Traders would closely watch stocks data on Friday, the first since the February prompt date. LME inventories were expected to see a modest fall, traders said. Most of the other metals ended weaker, but aluminium showed independence and finished $3 firmer at $1,607. Zinc shed $14 to $1,216 after failing for the second day to break above $1,234/5. Nickel, which has also had a good run recently, lost $60 to finish at $7,850. Tin declined $45 to $6,020 and lead lost $3 to $667. Alloy was up slightly at $1,532/5 versus $1,530. - - - - GRAINS CBOT wheat futures closed strongly higher on a surge in soybeans and on a fund-related rally in corn, traders said. Export events were sparse with Japan a buyer this week of 60,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat. But Japan also purchased 60,000 from Canada and 60,000 from Australia, the Japanese Food Agency said. Also the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) said there were no successful bids in the latest national pool tender and the European Union's export rebate Thursday was about in line with what Paris-based grain exporters were predicting. French traders later Thursday said the EU, helped by a higher dollar, reduced wheat export subsidies and that will prevent exporters from carrying out business with Egypt and Iran. Wheat closed 4-1/4 to 6-1/2 cents per bushel higher, with March up 4-1/4 at $3.63-3/4. New crop July closed 6-1/4 cents higher at $3.53-1/4. - - - - OIL NYMEX crude sharpened losses Thursday afternoon as traders rolled positions out of the prompt month ahead of the March contract expiry amid bearish stock data indicating growing crude supply. At 1343 EST, March crude was 79 cents a barrel lower at $22.00. March heating oil was off 1.34 cents a gallon at 58.25 cents while March gasoline stood 1.83 cents a gallon lower at 62.85 cents. &quot;The API numbers were pretty bearish, and the Iraq news did not help,&quot; said a dealer. The United Nations sanctions committee on Iraq approved deeper discounts for Iraqi crude sales to the U.S., diplomatic sources said Thursday. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute (API) said crude stocks grew 3.1 million barrels for the week ended February 14. The data also showed a year-over-year crude surplus of 5.8 milllion barrels, the first year-over-year stock surplus since the week ended November 1, 1996 when there was a 3.1 million barrel surplus. Technically, prompt crude broke psychological support of $22.00 and fell to a session low of $21.95 - still ahead of Wednesday's low of $21.90. - - - - GOLD New York precious metals futures ended sharply higher Thursday, led by heavy short covering in gold which pushed the April gold contract back up to its highest level in nearly a month. COMEX April gold ended up $5.00 an ounce, after seeing its highest levels intraday since January 29 at $354.00. The April/June spread continued to narrow, ending at $1.90 an ounce. Estimated total futures volume was a high 60,000 lots. In the bullion market, spot gold ended quoted $350.40/90 an ounce compared to the London Thursday afternoon fix at $345.00 and the New York close Wednesday at $345.00/50. Traders said sentiment was also helped by news that the South African Reserve Bank governor, Chris Stals, said he thought the Belgian and Dutch central bank gold sales last year would not be followed by other central bank gold sales. - - - - CAPE TOWN - Gold sales by the central banks of Belgium and the Netherlands were unlikely to be duplicated by other central banks, South African Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals said on Thursday. &quot;I think substantial sales like those are something of the past. I don't think we'll see much of it in future,&quot; he told a roadshow of local institutions in Cape Town. Stals said he believed Belgium and the Netherlands were the only two countries which felt uncomfortable with the size of their gold portfolios. - - - -  Last trades or bids for key Australian-interest commodities.

E12,E21,E212,ECAT	 International Monetary Fund experts have completed their assessment of the Russian economy and have recommended that the IMF board should meet on Friday on whether to pay out delayed loan tranches to Russia, the fund's chief representative in Moscow, Tom Wolf, said on Tuesday. &quot;We have completed our assessment. We finished late yesterday. IMF management has recommended that the board meet on Friday, December 13 to decide whether to approve the release of the tranches,&quot; Wolf told Reuters.   Another IMF mission will arrive on Monday to start work the following day on the next regular monthly assessment of the economy, and will stay about a week, Wolf said. Wolf declined to forecast whether the board would approve paying the delayed tranches under Russia's three-year $10.2 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) loan programme. Fund missions visiting Russia had delayed a decision on whether to recommend the board pay out the monthly tranches for October and November because IMF officials were worried by Russia's poor tax collection performance. The effective suspension of the IMF loan forced the Russian authorities to boost tax collection by closing loopholes and threatening to have large corporate tax debtors declared bankrupt. As a result tax revenues picked up in October and November from September's low point. The money is likely to be released if the issue now gets as far as the IMF board, sources close to the talks said. But the board would be likely to release only one tranche this time. Russian Central Bank first deputy chairman Sergei Aleksashenko said previously that the IMF board reviews only one tranche at a time. If tax revenue remains on a positive trend, it would be possible to catch up with the delayed tranches early in 1997, the sources said. Work on the detailed programme for next year under the EFF is not as far advanced as IMF and Russian officials would like. It has been delayed both by the extra discussions involved on the final tranches for this year, and the slow progress of the 1997 budget throught the State Duma lower house of parliament. The Duma is now due to debate the 1997 budget in a first reading on Sunday December 15, which will be a working day in Russia. The current draft of the budget up for discussion calls for a deficit of 3.5 percent of gross domestic product and annual inflation of 11-12 percent. Economists said the IMF was likely to be comfortable with those parameters, but -- like many Duma deputies -- it could be concerned that projected revenues of 431 trillion roubles were overambitious. The fund will want to avoid a repetition of this year's problems, where taxes came in well below budgeted levels. --Jonathan Lynn, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520

GCAT,GSPO	 Top Norwegian goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt, 33, has decided to retire after being out of the game for six months with a back injury, the daily Verdens Gang (VG) said on Tuesday. &quot;Now I have finally decided to retire I feel relieved. I had hoped to come back, but when I had to question whether I could get to the end of a single training session, I knew it was over,&quot; Thorstvedt told VG. &quot;Maybe my back would have held out, but I risk other injuries if I continue to play.&quot; Thorstvedt won 97 caps for Norway.

C15,C152,CCAT	 Ceramco Corp Ltd executive chairman David Appleby said he expected a modest turnaround in the company's loss-making apparel division but that it would probably take 18 months to show a significant improvement. Ceramco, an apparel and ceramics manufacturer, earlier reported a slump in operating earnings to NZ$4.71 million in the year to March from $7.46 million as year earlier. After non-recurring items and tax, the profit fell to NZ$0.96 million from $11.32 million. &quot;In the current year we would expect a return (from apparel) to modest profit levels,&quot; Appleby told Reuters.   &quot;Certainly, we expect to wipe out the loss of NZ$2.61 million that (the unit) achieved in 1996/7 year,&quot; he said. &quot;We are forecasting to make modest (1997/98) profit levels but it would be naive, both in terms of the market place and in terms of where we've come from, to say that it would be a quick turnaround,&quot; he said. &quot;It's not going to be a huge return to big earnings because it takes 18 months and the market isn't out there to have super profits,&quot; he said.   Appleby said surplus property would be sold, but that a split up and sale of the company's apparel and mining operations was not imminent. &quot;Our view has been that if you were to entertain that idea, clearly you've got to get both sides of the business profitable. It's not something we are looking at but clearly you've got to have a flexible view,&quot; he said. Ceramco entered 1996/7 with a budget that was too ambitious. It was also too slow to cut its costs to meet the deterioration in apparel turnover, he said.   &quot;Obviously there is a lot more work to do to get the profit back to where we want it to be. We have certainly cut the rot at this stage and we are looking to improve the result, but we were just too slow to react in the first six months of the year.&quot; In reporting its divisional results for the first time, apparel fell to its NZ$2.61 million loss from a $0.46 million profit a year earlier. Profits from mining, including the ceramics business, fell to NZ$4.79 million from 5.34 million. Corporate and investment earnings rose to NZ$2.54 million from $1.66 million, it noted -- Wellington Newsroom +64-4 473 4746
C13,CCAT	 The Hungarian parliament on Tuesday passed a bill allowing building societies to operate in Hungary for the first time. The bill, which will become law on January 1, specifies that a building society must have a minimum one billion forints ($6.3 million) in equity to begin operations. Interest rate on deposits will be three percent, while the deposits would be complemented with a 30 percent, or a maximum 36,000 forints, state subsidy per year. Depositors may only take out a loan after four years of saving. Hungary has chosen the German 'Bausparkasse'-model in which building societies are separated from other types of financial institutions. They will also provide equity financing for home construction. Several domestic banks, including the largest Hungarian commercial bank OTP, have announced plans to expand with foreign partners into the housing finance market, expecting increased economic growth and spending on home constructions -- Duncan Shiels, Budapest newsroom +361 327 4040
GCAT,GVIO	 Gerry Adams, head of the IRA's political wing, said on Saturday he regretted including a fictional account of an Irish guerrilla in his new autobiography because some people said it proved he had been an IRA sniper. &quot;I now regret that section is in the book,&quot; he said at a book signing for the Greek edition of &quot;Before the Dawn&quot;, his &quot;personal narrative&quot; of growing up in Northern Ireland. Adams said his editor wanted a piece in the book on the role of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrilla group. He obliged with a story he had written years before because he had neither the &quot;time nor the inclination&quot; to write about the subject. &quot;But I now regret doing that because some more mischievous elements have described that as (showing) that I was a sniper, which I wasn't,&quot; he told Reuters Television. Adams is the president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA guerrilla group fighting against British rule in Northern Ireland. The book is an account of Adams' childhood in West Belfast in the 1950s and during sectarian fighting between Roman Catholics and Protestants in the province in the late 1960s. Adams devoted several pages to a fictional account of an IRA gunman in the otherwise autobiographical book, which he called a personal narrative based on his recollections. He lamented a decision by the Australian government to refuse him a visa this month to take part in a promotional tour for the book. &quot;I wasn't surprised. When I went to go to the USA, the British government went quite hysterical,&quot; he said. The Australian government said Adams had failed to meet &quot;good character&quot; criteria and cited his intimate association with the IRA, he said. &quot;I think it's a pity that the Australian government doesn't trust the people in Australia. I think it's a pity that the Australian government bowed to that kind of paranoia,&quot; he said. Adams is planning a promotional tour in the United States when the book is published there next February and pro-British groups have called for Washington to deny him a visa. Asked about efforts to secure a renewed IRA ceasefire and with it a place for Sinn Fein at ongoing multi-party peace talks, he repeated Sinn Fein's position that British Prime Minister John Major holds the key. Major on Thursday insisted the IRA must renounce violence completely before Sinn Fein could be admitted to the talks. Adams said the fundamental problem was that the British government had not yet accepted the idea of a negotiated settlement. &quot;I think the real reason is that the British government has yet to come around to the acceptance of the need for a negotiated settlement, and by virtue of a negotiated settlement it is implicit that they accept that they can't win, that they can't beat (Irish) Republicans,&quot; he said.

GCAT,GSPO	 Austria's Mario Reiter fulfilled one of his biggest ski racing dreams on Sunday by winning the Kitzbuehel men's slalom ahead of Italian superstar Alberto Tomba to the delight of a 40,000 home crowd. &quot;To win ahead of Tomba is an enormous achievement,&quot; said a delighted Reiter. &quot;Winning Kitzbuehel has always been my dream. I won't be skiing for much longer so it's good I've fulfilled one of my goals aleady. I worked all year for this win, &quot; he added. Reiter, the 1996 world championship slalom silver medallist, clocked a winning aggregate time of one minute 36.09 seconds on the Ganslern piste, for his third career World Cup win. He was 0.19 seconds ahead of Tomba, who produced a wild but fast second run to improve on a first-leg fifth place for overall second. &quot;I am accustomed to winning, it's difficult for me to be second. But today I'm pleased with second place because the conditions in the second run were so bad,&quot; said Tomba. The Italian world and Olympic champion had completed only two of the season's slaloms before Sunday because of wrist and knee injuries which were followed by a bout of flu. He was second in his first appearance on the circuit in December in Madonna di Campiglio. On Sunday, Tomba demonstrated he is in good form for his home world championships starting next Sunday in Sestriere. &quot;Everyone in Italy expects me to do well in Sestriere just because I'm in the race. It's an important event for me,&quot; said Tomba, who took slalom and giant slalom gold at last year's world championships in Sierra Nevada. Reiter's victory came as a surprise as the 26-year-old Austrian had a weak start to the season following health problems he did not want to discuss. &quot;I am still not 100 percent yet. I was only 80 percent today. The audience gave me the missing 20 percent which I needed for this win,&quot; said Reiter. The 26-year-old Austrian is now anxiously awaiting Sestriere, where he won his only other slalom in a night race last winter. &quot;I still have two weeks to prepare for world championships. Until today, I was still not qualified. I was the fifth Austrian and only four can participate. &quot;I am a silver medallist, but now I would like gold medals at world championships and Olympics. But I still think (Austrians Thomas) Sykora and (Thomas) Stangassinger are the favorites for Sestriere.&quot; The in-form Sykora, who was suffering from hip pains after a fall in Sunday morning's free practice, disappointed in the second run and fell back from first place in the opening run to overall seventh. Last year's winner here, Sykora has won five of the seven slaloms he has stated so far this season and finished second once. It was the first time in a year he had failed to finish on the slalom World Cup rostrum. &quot;I didn't ski well today. I was too direct going into the gates,&quot; said Sykora. Stangassinger, who finished second three times this season and third twice, fell back a position from a first-run third to fourth. Norway's Finn Christian Jagge, the 1992 Olympic slalom champion, made his first appearance on a World Cup podium since 1994, with third place on Sunday in 1:36.54. His compatriot and defending overall World Cup champion Lasse Kjus won the combined event which twinned Sunday's slalom with Saturday's downhill.. Another Norwegian, Kjetil Andre Aamodt was second in the combined to take the lead in the overall standings on 701 points, while Austrian Werner Franz was third.
E41,E411,ECAT,GCAT,GJOB	 The unemployment rate edged higher and job growth slowed in November, the government said on Friday, soothing financial markets after critical remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan sent Wall Street on a wild ride. The Labour Department, in the government's first assessment of the economy's performance in November, said unemployment rose to 5.4 percent last month as 118,000 new jobs were created. The jobless rate was 5.2 percent in October, when 224,000 jobs were created. The department had previously estimated October job creation at 210,000. For Wall Street, the new data on jobs served as a mild tonic after a steep stock market slide of more than 100 points that was sparked by Greenspan's remarks Thursday night suggesting that overheated markets can pose economic dangers. Stock and bond markets, which had been worried that a drop in unemployment would signal the economy was shaking off a needed slowing that would keep inflation in check, gathered strength from the new data. &quot;Today's unemployment data had the effect of erasing concerns that had surfaced in the last few days that the (unemployment) rate had fallen and job creation had been very strong,&quot; said David Resler of Nomura Securities. &quot;After Mr. Greenspan's reality check ... had caused markets around the world to tank, unnecessarily because nothing in the speech indicated any change in Fed thinking, the soft jobs report helped bouy prices,&quot; added First Union economist Joel Naroff. The report was weaker than estimated by Wall Street analysts, who had projected the November unemployment rate would remain unchanged and that 179,000 jobs would be produced. The department said workers' average hourly earnings, closely watched for signs of wage inflation, rose 9 cents an hour after being down a revised one cent an hour in October. The wage increase, however, was largely dismissed by Bureau of Labour Statistics Commmissioner Katharine Abraham, who said the number was often volatile. &quot;As I mentioned in June, when we had a similarly large jump, the monthly movements in earnings are quite erratic,&quot; she told reporters. The report seemed to give additional weight to the view that the economy has been chugging along at a slowing pace, with few signs that inflation was becoming a problem. &quot;It's another example of how the economy has slowed down dramatically,&quot; said Irwin Kellner, chief economist at Chase Manhattan's Chase Regional Bank. &quot;One hundred eighteen thousand jobs is the weakest in recent memory and the fact is that most of the jobs that were created were service jobs and retail jobs, most of which were lower paying.&quot; Oscar Gonzalez of John Hancock Financial Services added, &quot;The economy continues to sputter along, but at least it hasn't thrown a rod.&quot; The Federal Reserve's latest Beige Book summary of national economic activity, released on Wednesday, suggested the economy was on course for slow but steady expansion, with little need for interest-rate rises to dampen inflation risks. The central bank's policy-makers meet Dec. 17 to decide the future course of interest rates. While the economy has clearly been slowing, it is still showing enough vitality to keep the momentum under way. For example, the Commerce Department reported Friday that factory orders rose more sharply than had been expected in October, overcoming the impact of a slowdown in the automotive industry. Total new orders rose 0.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted $321.3 billion following a revised 2.6 percent jump in September orders. Wall Street economists had forecast only a 0.2 percent gain in October orders. The Labour Department said job creation during last month reflected gains across the board, though some of them were modest, with the exception of government work, which showed a decline. The workweek rose by 0.2 hour last month to 34.5, while overtime increased by 0.1 hour to 4.5 hours. Goods-producing industries created 22,000 jobs, while the government cut jobs by an identical amount. The largest job gains were in the services area, with a 96,000 rise, while construction added 14,000 jobs and manufacturing added 9,000.

M14,M141,MCAT	 London's robusta coffee futures motored higher to close on Wednesday at or near session highs but traders said further upward moves could prove difficult. Benchmark January contract closed $13 up on the day at $1,449 a tonne after failing to clear a key chart barrier at $1,450. Speculative and fund buying as well as industry interest at the lows helped underpin values. Traders said a brief New York rally was also supportive. &quot;But after $1,440 (basis January) we saw very good origin selling in London. There's also a technical resistance there and the market was unable to break higher,&quot; one said. &quot;It is trying to build the base and trade higher but at the moment it is having great difficulty,&quot; he said. &quot;There's a lot of origin selling above,&quot; he added. Traders noted some keen selling from Ivory Coast and other African origins earlier in the session. Turnover on the exchange reached 2,850 lots, with January garnering the bulk of the volume. Jan/March spread stood at $58 at the close, against $53 on Tuesday. Coffee options saw some 1,020 lots traded, involving mainly crosses on March, May and July. There was also a straddle involving March $1,350 calls and puts. Analysts said with little fundamental influence, coffee could remain locked in the tight band of $1,420 and $1,450. &quot;Robusta is a dead dog,&quot; said one. &quot;There's not much upside potential or downside potential so far unless we get a few thousand lots of buying or a few thousand lots of selling to move us away from that range.&quot; The next key chart hurdle is pegged at $1,476, the last high seen on November 7, while support is seen at $1,415. --Jalil Hamid, London Newsroom +44 171 542 4985

C12,C13,CCAT,GCAT,GCRIM	 Some rivals may be greeting the scandal at Nomura Securities with secret glee, but others worry that damage to the giant firm will dent the overall credibility of the Japanese market and the brokerage industry. &quot;Naturally, there is the aspect that other brokerages will temporarily win business that ordinarily would have gone to Nomura,&quot; said one Japanese brokerage source. &quot;On the other hand, the fact that Japan's leading brokerage is involved in such an affair could lead to a decline in confidence in Japan's securities market,&quot; the source added. The high-profile scandal took another twist last week when Tokyo prosecutors served new arrest warrants on former Nomura president Hideo Sakamaki and two other former Nomura executives, alleging that the three conspired in March 1995 to pay 320 million yen ($2.78 million) to Ryuichi Koike, the corporate racketeer at the heart of the affair. The scandal has already led to more than a dozen arrests including executives from Nomura and one of Japan's biggest banks, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd (DKB), and worries persist that other financial firms will be entangled. News of the fresh allegations, which came the same day prosecutors charged Sakamaki with violating the Commercial Code by paying Koike 49.73 million yen ($432,000) between January 31 and June 15, 1995, sparked concern that the resolution of the scandal would be delayed as prosecutors continue their probe. Experts had expected authorities to decide administrative punishment for Nomura, which could include suspension of some business, including dealing on its own account, for up to six months by the end of this month. Now, however, no move is thought likely until at least late July. Some rival domestic brokerages including second-ranked Daiwa Securities Co Ltd have been actively wooing clients who are shunning Nomura because of the scandal, and some foreign firms have also benefitted a bit, industry sources said. But some rivals fear the short-term gains of added business could pale in contrast to the blow to the market should industry-leader Nomura be seriously and permanently damaged. &quot;Nomura has dominated this market and I believe all the others have tried to catch up. We need somebody (to chase). It doesn't have to be Nomura...but Nomura's resources in terms of technology and numbers and quality of manpower are extraordinarily high,&quot; another industry source said. &quot;People talk about the 'Big Four' (Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko Securities Co Ltd and Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd), but it's really one plus three,&quot; the source added. However the saga plays out, many experts say the present pain being felt by Nomura and DKB is a necessary prelude to bringing industry ethics in line with global standards as Japan implements its &quot;Big Bang&quot; reforms, which are aimed at boosting competition in its long-sheltered financial sector. &quot;The reforms are aimed at creating fair and transparent markets,&quot; the first source said. &quot;It may be painful, but what is happening now is a necessary development to move to the new era.&quot; ($1=115 yen)
M14,M143,MCAT	 NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures staged a late-session selloff and closed down Monday, with front months tanking as fears about Hurricane Edouard waned and technical selling accelerated when support was broken. September expired 9.7 cents lower at $1.853 per million British thermal units. October settled down 8.6 cents at $1.937. Other deferreds ended off by 0.7 to 6.3 cents. &quot;We were up early on Edouard and then came off. It was a consistent move down today, and we're looking for a base,&quot; said one New York-based futures trader, adding an October test of next support in the $1.90 area could hold.   At 1100 EDT, Hurricane Edouard, was 515 miles east of the Leeward Islands, moving west-northwest at 15 mph with winds of 130 mph. Most forecasters did not expect the storm to move into the Caribbean but said it was possible it could threaten the U.S. East Coast. Traders said below-normal Midwest and East Coast temperatures this week should keep the cash on the defensive as bidweek winds down. Technically, traders said today's breakdown likely means more pressure near-term for the new spot contract. They now pegged near support in October in the $1.925-1.93 area, today's low and a prominent low from January 16. Further buying should emerge in the high-$1.80s, with resistance seen in the low-teens. U.S. Gulf Coast swing prices firmed about five cents Monday to the high-$1.90s. Midcon pipes were up a couple of cents to the mid-$1.70s or better. The 12-month strip slipped 3.9 cents to $2.068. NYMEX said 58,512 Henry Hub contracts traded, up from Friday's revised tally of 39,732. NYMEX September Permian natgas closed down five cents at $1.64, while deferreds settled steady to three cents lower but were untraded. NYMEX said 15 Permian contracts traded, down from Friday's total of 42. NYMEX September Permian natgas futures expire Wednesday August 28. On the KCBT, September finished down 8.1 cents at $1.685, while deferreds ended mixed. The East/West spread narrowed by 1.6 cents to 16.8 cents (NYMEX premium). KCBT said 524 lots traded, up from Friday's 369. KCBT September natgas futures expire Tuesday, August 27. --J Silha, New York Power Desk 212-859-1624
M11,MCAT	 Dutch shares finished stronger on Monday setting another all-time closing high as the general market raced along in Wall Street's slipstream and bids and buybacks lifted several individual stocks. The AEX shot up at the open, easily clambering more than five points above its prior intraday life high, helped by strong sentiment on other European bourses, a firm dollar and a fresh record in New York on Friday, traders said. Trading was brisk throughout the session with the AEX first retracing some early gains before rallying again into the close to end just shy of its record intraday peak.   The index reached an intraday peak of 623.31, compared with its previous record, set on Friday, of 615.75. KLM was the individual share with the most go through the day, on news of preliminary talks with the Dutch government about a partial buy-back of the state's 38.2 percent stake in the flag carrier. Such a transaction would be good news for the shareprice, one analyst said, enhancing KLM's book value and future earnings per share and simplifying the airline's stated goal of finding industry partners. KLM shares were the second most heavily traded on the day.   The shares at one stage gained nearly 10 percent as investors scrambled fo scrip. &quot;The gain is purely speculative, we don't know whether any transaction wil go ahead, but investors seem to like the idea,&quot; one dealer said. Banking giant ABN-AMRO also followed through on Friday's gains after it announced the acquisition of Standard Federal Bancorp of the U.S. ABN shares finished at a new year-high of 112.10 guilders. Smaller high-techs also gained, brokers said, after semiconductor industry and company outlook upgrades by several U.S. houses. Shares in ASM Lithography jumped again after firming Friday, finishing up over six percent at 74.00. BE Semiconductor Industries also gained around six percent to 21.80.

C13,C31,CCAT,E21,E211,ECAT,GCAT,GPOL	 Florida's Hillsborough County Commission has rejected a gasoline tax increase to expand bus services, prompting advocates for the handicapped to threaten a lawsuit. The Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority sought a gasoline tax of at least two cents a gallon in order to offset a $4.5 million budget shortfall. The authority said that without the money it would be forced to cut routes by 10 percent and lay off up to 100 employees. The agency also said it could not provide services mandated by the Americans With Disabilities Act without the gas tax revenue. The county commission voted 4-3 Wednesday in favor of a one-cent tax but state law required a supermajority vote of at leat 5-2 for the proposal to pass.

M11,M12,M13,M132,MCAT	 Stocks broke records for a second straight session on Monday, but bonds fell as investors took profits after last week's gains. The dollar fell sharply for the second consecutive session as concerns mounted over Japan's growing trade surplus and Europe's plan to launch a single currency. The Dow Jones industrial average ended 42.72 points higher at 7,478.50, the second straight record finish for the blue chip index. Including the day's gains, the Dow has surged more than 1,000 points since the start of 1997. In the broader market, advancers outpaced decliners 1,414 to 1,087 on volume of 465.6 million on the New York Stock Exchange. Though the session lacked the sheer firepower displayed Friday -- when the Dow jumped 130.49 points -- it brought the Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 stocks and the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq composites to all-time highs. Leading the rally among blue chips were technology and drug stocks, as investors focused on the potential export benefits of a weaker U.S. dollar. Over the last five weeks, the dollar has fallen sharply against the Japanese yen and has recently begun struggling against the German mark, which has firmed on mounting uncertainty over issues related to European Monetary Union. &quot;For the most part, the groups going up today you could cover with the umbrella of exports,&quot; said Greg Nie, technical analyst at Everen Securities. &quot;Techs and drug companies are both beneficiaries of a declining dollar.&quot; Comcast Corp. jumped 2-13/16 to 21-1/16 after Microsoft Corp. agreed to make a $1 billion investment in the company, a move that significantly broadens the software giant's reach in the broadcast business. Cablevision Systems Corp. soared 9-1/2 to 44-1/8 after it said it would buy 10 cable systems in the New York area from Tele-Communications Inc. for stock worth more than $500 million, after factoring in the day's gains. The developments sparked life into the cable sector, which had languished for an extended period, analysts said. Financial stocks ended lower. The group was an indirect casualty of the declining dollar, which contributed to a weak performance in the bond market. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 18/32, or $5.63 on a $1,000 bond, pushing the yield up to 6.82 percent from 6.80 percent at Friday's close. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions. The dollar fell as low as 1.7020 German marks in early U.S. trading, 4 pfennigs below the 39-month high reached Friday in European trade, and dropped to a six-month low of 111.80 Japanese yen in Asian trade as nerves frayed ahead of Wednesday's scheduled release of fresh Japanese trade figures. The dollar fetched 1.7065 marks and 112.90 yen late Monday, down from 1.7247 marks and 114.37 yen late Friday. Coffee prices closed sharply higher as weather forecasts calling for another chilly night in top producers Brazil triggered a wave of buying by speculators. At the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, coffee for July delivery surged 16.05 cents a pound -- or nearly seven percent -- to close at 253.30 cents. That compares to the 20-year high of 318 cents a pound set late last month. In the grain markets, weather forecasts showing temperatures in the Midwest climbing back to normal levels helped prompt a sharp fall in soybean futures at the Chicago Board of Trade. A large buildup of &quot;short&quot; or selling positions by commercial grain firms also added pressure. Soybeans for July delivery closed down 24-1/2 cents a bushel at $8.11, with many speculators exiting the market. Overseas, London's benchmark FTSE 100 share index closed 41.7 points higher at 4,686.7, just 7.6 points off its May 16 record close. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 ended 261.93 points, or 1.28 percent, lower at 20,223.82.
C15,C152,C18,C181,CCAT	 Shiva Corp stock rose five points Wednesday amid resurgent speculation that it may be an acquisition target of a major network equipment player.     &quot;It sure looks like people are speculating that its going to be taking over,&quot; said Robertson Stephens analyst Paul Johnson, who maintains a long-term attractive on the stock.     Shiva shares have risen nearly 14 percent in the last two days. By early afternoon Wendesday, the stock was trading at 53-3/4, up 5 points on the day.     Shiva declined comment on what it called &quot;a market rumor.&quot;  &quot;We have had rumors like this before,&quot; said Cynthia Deysher, Shiva's chief financial officer. &quot;Our firm policy on this is not to comment on market rumors,&quot; she said.     Several analysts said signs of merger speculation were apparent in the stock's recent gains.     Cowen &amp; Co analyst Chris Stix noted that Shiva was mentioned in a trade magazine gossip column published Monday as among potential merger candidates in the network industry.     The article, published in the November 11 issue of Communications Week, spoke of a possible tie-up between rival Ascend Communications Inc and Shiva, among others.     Stix said another factor behind the rebound in recent weeks of Shiva's share price may be the company's comments in public forums that it has a potential major contract win with a major telecom carrier it has declined to name.     The Cowen analyst maintains a strong buy on Shiva.     The stock hit a low of 38 in late September, following a steep three-month decline from its historic high of 87 reached in June, when it was a favorite among momentum investors.     Although enthusiastic about Shiva's business fundamentals, Johnson discounted any recent product announcements as the cause behind the recent share price moves.    &quot;This doesn't appear to me that its product-related. It's too violent,&quot; he said. &quot;It's not valuation-related either.&quot;     Analysts consider Shiva one of two pure plays in the explosively growing market for remote access telecommunications equipment. The other is high-flying Ascend, the dominant player in the market.     Johnson said Shiva might also prove attractive to any of the large data networking companies seeking to gain quick market share in the remote access business.     &quot;With a company in Shiva's position, I can't think of a company that wouldn't be interested,&quot; he said.  Johnson said that Shiva, which by his estimates has 13 percent of the remote access market, may prove attractive to any of the major network industry leaders -- Cisco Systems Inc, 3Com Corp or Bay Networks Inc.     He left off Cabletron Systems Inc from the list of potential buyers, noting that Cabletron had acquired Network Express Inc in May to beef up its remote access line.     Shiva has carved out a strategic niche in the market for remote acccess products, which are used by companies, Internet service providers and telecommunications carriers to handle data communications over far-flung wide-area networks.     Shiva is the No. 3 supplier in remote acccess, behind Ascend, which  holds 40 percent of the market, and U.S. Robotics, a more diversified company with a 31 percent share, according to Johonson's estimates.     Stix said Shiva, in partnership with Northern Telecom Ltd, has the lead in a new type of network switching product that allows telephone carriers to address the growing overload of their voice networks by Internet data traffic.     -- Wall Street bureau, 212-859-1736  REUTER
GCAT,GVIO	 An apparent car bomb exploded near a Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, Israeli security sources said. They said there may have been casualities among Palestinians in the area.   The sources said the bomb, which may have been placed in a car or on a horsecart, went off near a bus at an Israeli checkpoint less than one km (half a mile) from Kfar Darom settlement. The area has been especially tense in recent weeks as the Israeli-Palestinian peace process plunged into crisis over work on a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem. Witnesses said a bomb exploded soon after the bus left the settlement. Rescue officials said there was no immediate word of casualties.

C13,C24,C33,CCAT,GCAT,GPOL,GVIO	 Amid scenes of chaos, Taiwan's parliament voted late on Friday to restore funding for the island's fourth nuclear power station. Local television station TVBS said the vote was 83 to 0 as opposition lawmakers did not cast ballots.   As word of the outcome reached Taipei's streets, anti-nuclear activists hurled eggs, chairs and rocks at the parliament building and broke down a police barricade surrounding it. Police in riot gear responded by spraying the crowd of several thousand with water cannon. Leaders of the parliament, where the ruling Nationalist Party holds a scant 51 percent majority, fought through the day -- sometimes with their fists -- to evict opposition lawmakers from the parliament dais, which they had occupied as part of a filibuster in a bid to stop a vote they knew they would lose.   Parliament leaders managed to collect and count the ballots after a 9.30 p.m. (1330 GMT) deadline. The ballot collection triggered a scramble among opposition lawmakers who complained they had not been given a chance to vote. In the end the only ballots collected were those of Nationalist deputies, ensuring the result. The vote restored funding for the US$4.1 billion fourth nuclear power station to be built by U.S. contractor General Electric Co outside the capital Taipei. Parliament had voted in May to cancel funding, prompting the government appeal that led to Friday's final vote.
E12,E13,E131,ECAT,M13,M132,MCAT	 Adoption of a currency board would stabilise Bulgaria's national currency, curb inflation and boost economic growth, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in a statement on Wednesday. &quot;Undoubtedly the currency board can quickly reduce inflation in Bulgaria and the benefits will be worth the value of its introduction,&quot; said the IMF. Under a currency board -- a system introduced by some countries to boost credibility in their currencies -- the amount of currency in circulation must be matched exactly by hard currency reserves. Such systems deprive the central bank of the usual tools of monetary management, such as market intervention and interest rates. Critics of the idea have said that unless Bulgaria boosts exports, restricted hard currency flow would stifle the economy. The IMF said in a statement that a currency board would only succeed in Bulgaria if it was supported by a sufficiently austere budget and broad social and political consunsus. Senior IMF officials are discussing with the government and bankers the introduction of a board as a means to stabilise the crumbling economy and restore confidence in the lev. Nikolai Koichev, head of parliament's economy commission, told reporters a board should be introduced through legislation. IMF officials say that if Bulgaria agrees, a board would take two to three months (Corrects to months from years) to be introduced. The IMF has twice postponed a $115 million loan so far due to Bulgaria's failure to meet reform targets which include curbing inflation, stabilising the exchange rate, speeding up privatisation and closing loss-making enterprises. Personal and company deposits worth up to $600 million have been withdrawn from banks this year and a quarter of the country's banks were placed in receivership in a bid to prevent their collapse. The central bank has sought the bankruptcy of 13 banks through the courts, which have not yet ruled on the cases. Delayed structural reforms and a stagnant economy pressured the lev to 249 to the dollar on Wednesday, compared with around 70 in January. Converting lev income into dollars has become the most widespread form of saving. The IMF said economic growth would be achieved only if inflation was reduced to less than 50 percent a year. Bulgaria's nine-month cumulative inflation stood at 154 percent, topping its annual inflation target of 105 percent. Bulgaria has forecast a 10 percent decline of gross domestic product (GDP) this year. GDP sank by 6.2 percent in the first six months. In a bid to stabilise the lev, the central bank raised the central interest rate to a record-high 300 percent in September. It is currently 180 percent. -- Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-84561

GCAT,GDIP,GHEA,GVIO	 Various forms of agonising death await the refugees of eastern Zaire as their bodies, lacking water, food and strength, give up the fight. After days without water -- 24 hours is all it takes for small children -- the body's fluids thicken. The heart, unable to pump thick sludgy blood, fails and without urine, toxins build up and the kidneys shut down. &quot;You dry out, you turn into a potato crisp. It is a dreadful death,&quot; said Cathy Lyons, a doctor for the medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres who was one of the last aid workers to leave behind some 400,000 people in Mugunga camp near the east Zaire city of Goma. &quot;You go into a coma, then you die,&quot; Lyons said. &quot;It is a disgraceful death. You beg for water, until you can no more.&quot; Thousands have already died and even if a U.N. force to bring aid came today, many more would be too sick to save. MSF (Doctors without Frontiers) said on Tuesday they estimated some 1,000 were dying every day, based on their experience from working in crises around the globe. Other aid agencies question how accurate such figures can be and say they have no exact idea of the death toll in the war zone and beyond, but do know how most are meeting their end. Dehydration, cholera and other diarrhoea-type diseases are the first scourges, with starvation following on, doctors say. On dry volcanic rock, covering the hills to which many of the million-plus refugees have fled from their lakeside camps, lack of water is probably the first major killer. Cholera, a bacteria-based disease, and dysentery -- diarrhoea with blood -- cause rapid dehydration which often leads to death before the disease itself does. Cholera can breed in the lakes and be spread by the flies that multiply in corpses, which few people will have the energy or means to bury in the area's thin, patchy soil. &quot;With cholera you can dehydrate within 24 hours. We believe it has already set in,&quot; the MSF doctor said, adding that high numbers had been dying of illness at Mugunga before she left. When a million Rwandan Hutus first fled to the area in 1994, cholera took 30,000 lives in the first days before aid arrived. This time round, circumstances are as bad -- but different. The unreachable refugees who fled war at home have lived for two years in camps, with good health care and food. Hardened through misfortune, they have learned to cope and know the basics of how to look after themselves but may lack the necessary resources -- such as water cans, or spades to dig latrines or bury the dead and avoid contaminating water. Refugees who have trekked back to safety said they ate grass and wrung mud in their clothes to extract water from it. The start of the hot, rainy season has brought much-needed water, but with it more risk from disease or exposure. Starvation is another scourge but takes longer to kill. The strongest grab what little food there is and the weakest die. &quot;Hunger strikers in prison can take a month to die, but these people have been living on half-rations -- what you or I would have for breakfast. They are already malnourished and could starve after 10 days without food,&quot; Lyons said. When it cannot get food, the body breaks down muscle tissue for protein, pumping toxins into the system, killing through kidney failure unless illness gets there first. Some refugees from the area of Bukavu, south of Goma, fled their camps more than three weeks ago at the start of a local rebellion which has caused the latest Central African disaster. Hundreds of people died in the fighting but lack of food, water and hygiene will kill countless more. Those on the move will wear down quickly, speeding the onset of exhaustion and lack of resistance to disease. Those still at Mugunga may have better access to water, but it could become contaminated by faeces or corpses, experts say. Also, disease can spread more rapidly through such a concentration of people, especially if bodies pile up. In 1994, trucks carried the dead away. That is unlikely this time.

GCAT,GPOL,GVOTE	 Personal relations between Prime Minister John Major and opposition Labour party leader Tony Blair are near rock bottom as Britain moves towards a general election campaign. Major dislikes Blair's self-righteousness and Blair in turn scorns what he sees as the prime minister's weak and ineffectual leadership according to newspaper reports this week. At a ritual clash between the two during question time in parliament on Tuesday the prime minister was irritated enough by criticism of his spending on health to tell Blair to give up &quot;kindergarten soundbites&quot;. Reports trace the ill-feeling between the two back to the Dunblane massacre in March, when Major invited Blair to accompany him to the Scottish town where a crazed gunman had shot dead 16 children and their teacher. Blair felt the prime minister subtly belittled him during the visit. In turn Major was furious at what he saw as an attempt by Labour to make political capital out of the tragedy by inviting a Dunblane mother to appeal to its annual conference in October to back a ban on handguns. &quot;For John Major and Tony Blair, Dunblane and its aftermath seems to have been a turning point, and things have not improved since then,&quot; the Independent on Sunday wrote. But the antipathy also appears to be bound up with Major's contempt for anyone who he thinks is patronising him. Major boasted at his Conservative party's conference of how he had made the trek from two rooms in the run-down London inner-city neighbourhood of Brixton to the pinnacle of power in Downing Street. Blair, by contrast, has never known hard times. Born into a solid middle class family and educated at private school and Oxford university, the Labour leader would seem to epitomise in Major's eyes the establishment he loathes. According to reports, Major recently likened Blair to the fictional U.S. preacher Elmer Gantry, a Bible-thumping moraliser in Sinclair Lewis's 1927 novel who turned out to be a hypocrite and fraudster. The Times thought Gantry's character worthy of an editorial on Tuesday. The paper concluded that, while Blair's claim on the mantle of moral superiority clearly irks Major like nothing else, to compare the Labour leader to one of literature's most monstrous of fictional phonies, was surely a gibe too far. &quot;Sadly... we must assume that Mr Major was being unfriendly,&quot; The Times commented.

C18,C181,CCAT	 ZAO Surgutfondinvest has won an investment tender for 40.12 percent of Russian oil group NK Surgutneftegaz (Surgut Holding), Surgut Holding said on Tuesday. The state-owned 40 percent stake is currently held in trust by Surgut Holding's pension fund. Surgutfondinvest is a pension fund manager, but it was not immediately clear whether it was Surgut Holding's own pension fund. The starting price for the stake of four million shares was 410 billion roubles ($72.2 million). Besides Surgutfondinvest, one other bidder participated in the tender. Surgut Holding's pension fund is mostly owned by Surgut Holding. The winner of the tender must transfer five percent of Surgut Holding's main operating company, AO Surgutneftegaz to Surgut Holding. It must transfer 1.2 trillion roubles in investment in the company to Surgut Holding within three months, and pay another 100 billion roubles for social services in the Surgut region within a year. Surgut's pension fund won the stake in Surgut Holding in November 1995 in the first transaction under the controversial shares-for-loans programme, in which investors won the right to manage state-owned shares in partly privatised companies in return for loans to the government. The tender was the third sale of stakes acquired in shares-for-loans deals, following auctions of stakes in oil groups YUKOS and SIDANKO. In both these cases the auctions were won by companies appearing to be close to those who won the original shares-for-loans contests. The terms of Tuesday's tender made it practically certain that only a member of the Surgut group could win, as outside bidders would not have been able to meet the condition that they already own five percent of Surgutneftegaz, oil analysts said. --Jonathan Lynn, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520 ($ = 5676 Russian Roubles)
C14	 Plans for a mid-year float of shares in the Formula One Grand Prix motor racing business on the London and New York stock exchanges are likely to be stalled, Britain's Independent newspaper said on Thursday. The newspaper said Formula One's multi-millionaire owner Bernie Ecclestone had postponed flotation plans and had instructed his advisers to examine the alternative of a private sale. There were also doubts about the 2.5 billion stg ($4.1 billion) price tag put on Formula One's business when news of a planned flotation appeared two months ago, the Independent said. &quot;The sale, if it happens, is expected to put a significantly lower value on Formula One,&quot; it added. Ecclestone, one of Britain's richest men, is expected to retain his controlling stake in Formula One if a private sale takes place. The entrepreneur, president of the Formula One Constructors' Association and owner of the sport's promotion arm, has transformed motor racing into a spectacular event attracting a 450 million global television audience for each of the 16 Grand Prix events. The Independent said flotation plans had encountered problems over timing and fierce resistance from some constructors. These constructors were thought to be insisting they should emerge with the bulk of the share after the float, the newspaper said. A large number of interested parties, ranging from media companies to wealthy individuals, have expressed an interest in buying a stake in Formula One. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 4366 ($ = 0.614 British Pounds)

C15,C152,CCAT	 Shares in Bre-X Minerals Ltd. soared on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday as rumors continued to swirl around the Busang gold deposit and analysts sifted through drill results from the site. The Calgary, Alberta-based company's stock jumped C$1.22 to close at C$3.62 on massive turnover of 17 million shares on Canada's biggest stock market. Frenzied late afternoon trading pushed the volatile stock to a session high of C$5.75. Bre-X has been embroiled in controversy since preliminary tests by its partner, Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc., on the gold property indicated the deposit may contain &quot;insignificant&quot; amounts of gold. The announcement prompted panic selling of Bre-X shares last month, lopping almost C$3 billion ($2.2 billion), or more than 80 percent, from the company's stock market value. Reports on Wednesday that Freeport recently received the first independent tests of the Busang deposit by a Canadian firm were challenged by Freeport and Bre-X officials. The reports said Freeport received the tests while Freeport Chief Executive Jim Bob Moffett was in Indonesia and held meetings with President Suharto. &quot;The testing is still going on and Freeport has not been informed of any assay results,&quot; Freeport spokeswoman Kristen Lemkau told Reuters by telephone. Bre-X commissioned Toronto-based Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. last month to conduct an audit of its Busang project. The results are expected in early May. &quot;The audit was commissioned by Bre-X and it is going to be submitted to Bre-X,&quot; said Bre-X spokesman Richard Wool, adding that it was Bre-X that would release the audit results. Bre-X late on Tuesday released drill results from 22 holes at the Busang property that were not included in its resource calculation of 70.95 million ounces of gold released on February 17. Bre-X said 16 holes produced values ranging from 1.05 grams per tonne to 7.58 grams per tonne, while six holes showed no significant amount of gold. &quot;They were sort of old holes, but I think investors are taking it positively,&quot; said one mining analyst. John Kaiser, editor of the Kaiser Bottom-Fishing Report, said the drill results released on Tuesday were positive, but not enough to quash the controversy surrounding Busang. He said the final word on Busang was still up to two weeks away. &quot;We need to know what the numbers for this deposit run as produced by strictly controlled sampling, drilling and assaying procedures. Until we get a batch of results where we know that there is nothing screwy along the way, everything is uncertain,&quot; Kaiser said. The Busang saga took another curious twist on Wednesday when an Indonesian company linked to President Suharto raised its stake in the Busang property. Nusamba Group, 80 percent-owned by three foundations headed by President Suharto, raised its stake in the main Busang II section to 25 percent. Pt Askatindo Karya Minerals reduced its stake to five percent from 15 percent, said a spokesman for the family-owned company. Bre-X has a 45 percent stake in Busang, Freeport has 15 percent and the Indonesian government 10 percent.
GCRIM	 A New York judge on Monday sentenced a Latin American banker, son of a Cuban-born business tycoon, to 2 1/3 to seven years in prison for defrauding Venezuelan depositors of millions of dollars. Orlando Castro Castro, 47, had faced up to 25 years in prison when he was found guilty on Feb. 19 of fraud and grand larceny after a trial that lasted nearly four months in the Manhattan Supreme Court. Family patriarch and businessman Orlando Castro Llanes, 71, was earlier this month sentenced to at least one year but not more than three years in jail for his role in fraudulently transferring money through New York banks. The elder Castro is eligible for parole almost immediately because he has been in jail since his arrest in April last year. His grandson, Jorge Castro Barredo, 29, will be sentenced on May 5. The judge set a hearing for May 6 to decide on restitution and fines to be paid by the three bankers, who were all arrested in April 1996. Prosecutor Joseph Dawson argued that Castro Castro should be given the maximum sentence of up to 25 years in prison because he &quot;actively participated in the fraud.&quot; He said although no one in New York lost money in the scheme, the defendant and his family &quot;jeopardized the integrity of our banking system. &quot;This man used the New York banking system to defraud on an international level,&quot; Dawson said. Defence lawyer Robert Gage asked Supreme Court Judge Edward McLaughlin to show some mercy and impose the same sentence he had given Castro Llanes. He argued that his client worked out of loyalty to his father. Castro Llanes, his son and grandson, were accused of playing a key role in the banking scandal. Prosecutors accused them of illegally using deposits in a family controlled bank, Banco Progreso International de Puerto Rico (BPIPR), to prop up financial institutions they controlled in Central and South America. The prosecution said the three men misled Venezuelan depositors to believe BPIPR was a safe off-shore bank subject to tight regulatory control, attracting deposits of more than $55 million. Prosecutors also said the three defendants lied to regulators in Puerto Rico, falsely claiming BPIPR funds were held in Panama and not subject to Puerto Rican oversight. BPIPR closed in January 1995 with uninsured loses to depositors of more than $15 million.
GCAT,GPOL	 The Kremlin refused comment on Monday about the possibility that President Boris Yeltsin's heart surgery may be put off for up to two months. A spokesman told Reuters it may be days -- until a meeting of Russian and foreign specialists on Wednesday or Thursday -- before the administration had anything to say about the prospect of an expanding power vacuum around the sick president. The doctor tipped to carry out a planned bypass operation to relieve clogged cardiac arteries said in a television interview on Sunday that the 65-year-old leader could wait another 1-1/2 to two months and might have to resign himself to not having it. Renat Akchurin, maintaining a campaign by doctors in the past few days to debunk early Kremlin suggestions the operation would be straightforward, said the possible success depended on an in-depth analysis of his current condition. In an ironic twist, the cardiologist himself was unable for further comment on Monday due to illness. Colleagues said he had cancelled an operation on Monday due to a slight fever. Akchurin told Reuters on Saturday he had a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and self-consciously mopped sweat from his brow in Sunday's interview on NTV television. Yeltsin, who has a history of heart problems, has disappeared almost completely from public view since late June shortly before he was elected to a second term in the Kremlin after conducting a vigorous campaign across the vast country. He said in a televised interview earlier this month that he needed heart surgery and had agreed to undergo the operation, probably in late September. Akchurin, saying it could be delayed, said this week's medical council would determine the level of risk and preparedness for the operation. &quot;We will see how the patient is prepared for the operation. Any risk should be justified. If the risk is justified, go and do the operation. If it is not, don't do silly things,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to go through a certain preparatory period and Yeltsin, who whips us up all the time, seems to understand this. An earlier date of the operation means bigger risks.&quot; Generally speaking, he added, patients with complications had an 85 to 90 percent chance of survival. Asked whether the operation might have to be abandoned, Akchurin said: &quot;It is possible but special conditions should be created for the president then. We would be forced to limit his physical activities. He is not going to tolerate this.&quot; Amid speculation that leading figures are already jostling behind the scenes for the succession, Yeltsin has issued a decree confirming that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, his constitutional deputy, will govern if he is incapacitated. But he appears reluctant to loosen his grip on power for any substantial period of time. Kremlin sources says he is likely to transfer his powers, including control over the &quot;nuclear button&quot;, for only for a few hours while he is unconscious in the operation theatre. Yeltsin's daughter Tatyana, who has played an influential role in his entourage since the election campaign, told Russian television that he was keeping an eye on all major developments. &quot;He is attentively listening to reports about who called him and what was the message,&quot; she said, sounding defiantly upbeat. &quot;He reads newspapers and knows everything they say about him.&quot; She said her father was clearly anxious but, typically for him, was keeping his worries bottled up. Akchurin concluded the president was in a &quot;fighting mood&quot; and that would help him. The surgeon, who performed a bypass on Chernomyrdin about eight years ago, assured the interviewer he personally was quite calm about performing such a risky operation on the president. But he said he welcomed the advice of his former teacher, U.S. bypass pioneer Michael DeBakey, who is due to arrive in Moscow on Monday. Akchurin said DeBakey would not operate on Yeltsin but, calling the 88-year-old American the &quot;Leo Tolstoy of cardiology&quot;, said he might act &quot;as a father-figure&quot;.

A full text of the companies' press release follows. ---PRESS RELEASE------------------------------------ BERGEN BRUNSWIG AND IVAX SIGN $3.2 BILLION DEFINITIVE MERGER AGREEMENT Business Editors NEW YORK--(HealthWire)--Nov. 11, 1996-- Combined Business Integrates Manufacturing, Distribution and Supply Chain Management Bergen Brunswig Corporation (NYSE:BBC) and IVAX Corporation (AMEX:IVX) today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement that has been unanimously approved by their boards of directors. The new company, which will be known as BBI Healthcare Corporation, merges the financial strength and the nationwide healthcare distribution network of Bergen Brunswig with the broad product portfolio, promising pipeline, and manufacturing capabilities of one of the world's largest generic pharmaceutical companies, IVAX. BBI Healthcare will improve the affordability and quality of care available to consumers. &quot;This combination will enhance revenues, take advantage of synergies by streamlining the supply chain, improve margins, and create shareholder value that exceeds the value of Bergen and IVAX as stand-alone businesses,&quot;  said Robert E. Martini, 64, chairman and chief executive officer of Bergen Brunswig. Under the agreement, BBI Healthcare will acquire both Bergen Brunswig and IVAX through an exchange of common stock. IVAX shareholders will receive 0.42 shares of stock in the new company for each share of IVAX common stock.  Bergen Brunswig shareholders will receive 1.00 share of BBI stock for each share of Bergen Brunswig common stock.  After the merger, Bergen Brunswig and IVAX shareholders will hold approximately 44 percent and 56 percent, respectively, of BBI Healthcare common stock. Bergen Brunswig President and CEO-elect Donald R. Roden, 50, will become chief executive officer of BBI Healthcare. IVAX chairman and CEO Phillip Frost, M.D., 60, and Mr. Martini, 64, will serve as co-chairmen of the new company. In addition to Dr. Frost and Messrs. Martini and Roden, BBI Healthcare's board of directors will be comprised of seven members designated by IVAX and seven members designated by Bergen Brunswig. A steering committee has been formed to manage BBI Healthcare's integration.  Committee members are Dr.  Frost, Messrs.  Martini and Roden, Mr.  Neil Dimick, Bergen's chief financial officer, and IVAX Chief Operating Officer Richard C. Pfenniger, Jr. BBI HEALTHCARE BUSINESS STRATEGY BBI Healthcare's strategy will leverage the complementary businesses of Bergen Brunswig and IVAX to reduce operating costs, broaden distribution and increase sales while expanding margins for both companies.  BBI's goal is to create a low cost, high quality generic line that can be bundled with its branded and proprietary pharmaceutical and medical-surgical products.  The new company will be uniquely positioned to serve its customers at a time when $48 billion in current annual sales of branded pharmaceutical products are available or will become available in the next five years for generic substitution. &quot;BBI Healthcare will manage the supply chain together with our customers throughout the distribution process -- from the laboratory right to the patient,&quot;  explained Mr.  Roden. &quot;With the full integration of manufacturing and distribution, we can cut costs in the supply chain and help make healthcare more affordable.  Bergen Brunswig purchases nearly $2 billion in multisource pharmaceuticals each year.  As part of BBI Healthcare, IVAX will be able to penetrate broad new markets and increase sales of its generic and proprietary pharmaceuticals.&quot; &quot;IVAX's broad product line and extensive research pipeline is a unique asset which is fundamental to the paradigm and creates gross margin opportunities for the combined company,&quot; Roden said.  He added that BBI Healthcare will appoint a North American pharmaceutical operations head to oversee all manufacturing. Mr. Roden also explained that Bergen's Generic Purchasing Program (GPP), a unique, cost-effective program which offers a full line of generics, will be a key competitive advantage for the merged businesses.  GPP gives BBI Healthcare a competitive pricing advantage and provides participating suppliers with guaranteed volume and the ability to substantially add to their market share.  The GPP program will provide immediate distribution for IVAX's new generic drug applications as they are approved with greater savings to healthcare consumers. &quot;Our union with Bergen Brunswig links us to a drug distribution company that has been a source of strength in the industry for more than a century,&quot;  commented Dr.  Frost. &quot;Bergen Brunswig has created advanced distribution and customer service systems to support its more than 16,000 managed care, retail chain and independent pharmacy customers. In addition, Bergen contributes excellent financial systems, and I am particularly pleased that Neil Dimick will bring his expertise to BBI Healthcare as CFO.&quot; &quot;We are combining our efficient organization and consistent financial performance with IVAX's innovation and higher margins,&quot; commented Mr.  Martini.  &quot;Together, we will deliver earnings growth and the broadest, most technically advanced generic drug product line in the world. &quot;The merger also expands Bergen's business outside the United States for the first time,&quot;  Mr.  Martini continued. &quot;IVAX's Norton Healthcare subsidiary is the largest generic pharmaceutical company in the United Kingdom.  Under the direction of Isaac Kaye, Deputy CEO of IVAX, Norton serves as the hub of operations in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Poland, Germany, the Czech and Slovak Republics, and China. &quot;I am proud that Dr.  Samuel Broder, IVAX's Chief Scientific Officer, will lead BBI Healthcare's worldwide research and development programs.  Dr.  Broder served as director of the National Cancer Institute before joining IVAX, and was instrumental in the development of a number of important treatments for cancer and AIDS,&quot; Mr. Martini said. SUMMARY OF THE TRANSACTION The merger will be accounted for as a pooling-of-interests, and will be tax free to shareholders. BBI will have approximately 91 million primary common shares outstanding after the merger, which it expects to list on the New York Stock Exchange.  Subject to approval by BBI Healthcare's board of directors, Bergen Brunswig and IVAX expect the new company to pay annual dividends of 48 cents per share. Mr.  Martini and Dr.  Frost have each agreed to vote their shares in favor of the merger.  The merger is expected to close during the first quarter of 1997, pending regulatory approvals, the approval of shareholders and certain other conditions.  BBI Healthcare will be headquartered in Miami, Florida, and will employ more than 12,000 individuals worldwide. In connection with the merger, each company has granted to the other an option to purchase up to 19.9 percent of its newly issued shares, and has agreed to pay to the other break-up fees and to reimburse expenses in certain cases involving a competing transaction.

E11,E12,ECAT	 Upbeat news on President Boris Yeltsin's heart operation removes one of the biggest nightmares facing foreign investors, but analysts said the Russian economy needed bitter medicine to win its own new lease on life. The analysts said surgeons' comments that Yeltsin was doing well after a quintuple heart bypass operation on Tuesday could point to political stability ahead and encourage investors to buy into Russian firms or bonds. But Moscow still had to unravel a tangled web of tax and wage arrears to win a much-needed cash injection from the International Monetary Fund, which delayed paying one tranche of a $10 billion three-year loan last month. Rising social unrest -- workers demonstrated across Russia on Tuesday to complain that they had not been paid for months -- could tempt the government to loosen the monetary pursestrings, although officials have stressed that policy will be unchanged. &quot;We are fully resolved to stick to the course we chose,&quot; Finance Minister Alexander Livshits said as the clock ticked away to Yeltsin's long-awaited operation. The economic course, based on forcing inflation out of the Russian economy, has brought price rises down to their lowest year-on-year levels since reforms began. But industrial output has halved in five years and there are few signs of a sustainable turnaround. A mentality of non-payment has permeated every level of society, with the government among those who do not pay their bills. &quot;We now see clearly that lower inflation and a moderate budget deficit do not bring financial calm,&quot; Alexander Shokhin, a former economy minister who is now a deputy chairman of the State Duma lower house of parliament, told a news conference. &quot;We still need ...to make the real sector of the economy (industry) more attractive.&quot; Shokhin is a member of an emergency commission set up by President Boris Yeltsin last month to encourage recalcitrant firms to pay long overdue tax bills. The VChK commission shares the initials used by Felix Dzerzhinsky's feared Soviet-era secret police in the early years after the 1917 revolution. It has taken steps to declare a handful of tax debtors bankrupt, but its bark has so far been worse than its bite. One of four companies scheduled for bankruptcy has wriggled out of the trap and analysts said it was not clear whether the commission would be able to raise tax revenues significantly. &quot;I think the tax revenue thing is a big problem and it is not going to be easy to solve, but it can be solved with enough exertion of political will,&quot; said one Western economist. &quot;Everything that has been done in the last six weeks or so points in the right direction, but there have been so many false starts that one just has to be somewhat sceptical.&quot; Renaissance Capital said in a research note that the bankruptcy drive had started well. But it added: &quot;If the process is short, sharp and effective, an example will have been made and companies should continue to take the threat seriously. If the process is long and drawn out...bankruptcy will lose what credibility it currently has.&quot; The non-payments are only one of the problems facing Russia and the 1997 budget is stalled in the communist-dominated Duma. Investment -- essential to kick-start the sluggish economy -- has plunged this year due to high domestic interest rates and doubts about Russia's political future. But economists said Yeltsin's apparent early recovery from the operation could encourage foreigners to invest. &quot;It removes the political risk of a dead Yeltsin and means savings are more free to flow into industry,&quot; said Ronald Nash, chief economist at Renaissance Capital. He said Russia's forecast foreign investment of $800 million for 1996 would amount to $5.5 a head, compared to $381 a head in Hungary and an eastern European average of $87.
C31,CCAT	 Indonesia's largest automobile company PT Astra International said on Friday the country's total vehicle sales in 1996 were 331,150 units, compared with 385,070 units in 1995.   Astra said in a monthly statistical report Indonesia's vehicle sales, including exports, in December declined to 31,161 units from 32,800 units in November, and compared with a total of 30,950 units in December 1995. Astra said its market share fell to 50 percent in 1996 from 54.95 percent in 1995. Indonesia exported 5,361 units vehicles last year against 6,054 units in 1995. Total commercial vehicle sales were 287,899 units in 1996, compared with 340,916 units in 1995. Passenger car sales were 37,890 units in 1996 against 38,100 units in 1995. The report showed that commercial vehicle sales weakened to 26,401 units in December from 28,613 units in November. But passenger car sales improved 16 percent to 4,335 units in December from 3,633 units in November. The data showed that a slower growth in commercial vehicle sales was responsible for Astra's declining market share. But its passenger car sales indicated a strong uptrend, with December sales of 1,609 units -- its second highest turnover of the year against 1,731 units in March last year. Astra said Indonesian motorcycle sales, including exports, amounted to 1,377,206 units in 1996, compared with 984,419 units in 1995. Astra, the sole agent for Japan's Honda motorcycles, managed to maintain a stable market share of around 48 percent. Indonesia's motorcycle sales in December were 108,621 units against 139,272 units in November. -- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364

C33	 Alaska Air Group Inc.'s Horizon Air unit Wednesday ordered 25 new Bombardier Inc. Dash 8-200 turboprop airplanes in a deal valued at more than $270 million, officials said. Alaska has placed conditional orders for 15 additional planes and has taken options on 30 more, raising the value of the deal to more than $700 million if all options are exercised and orders completed. Delivery of the 25 airplanes will begin in the first quarter of next year and be completed by the second quarter of 1998, said Horizon spokeswoman Nancy Pappas. Pappas said the 37-seat Bombardier aircraft would replace the smaller 18-seat Fairchild Metroliner and 31-seat Dornier models in Horizon's fleet so all its propeller-driven planes will be Dash 8 models, including the older Dash 8-100. &quot;That will significantly reduce the cost of training, inventory and operations,&quot; Pappas said. The airline currently has a fleet of 63 aircraft, including 13 Fokker NV F-28 jets which seat up to 69 people. Colin Fisher, a spokesman for Bombardier's regional aircraft division in Toronto, said he did not know what conditions had been placed on the 15-plane segment of the order but said it was &quot;closer to a firm order than an option.&quot; Bombardier also said Horizon could convert its orders to buy the larger Dash 8-300 at relatively short notice. The Dash 8-300 airplanes seat 50 and sell for about $13 million, compared with slightly more than $10 million for the series 200 models. The planes are powered by engines made by United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada unit. Horizon serves 40 cities in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, California, western Canada and Alaska. Alaska Air's stock fell 12.5 cents to close at $21.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.

GCAT,GDIP	 Syria, sniping from the sidelines at the Middle East crisis summit in Washington, said on Wednesday Israel had chosen confrontation and warned the Jewish state it would pay a heavy price. Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara told the U.N. General Assembly in a speech that the recent Israeli-Palestinian clashes in the West Bank and Gaza showed that the new right-wing Israeli government had turned away from peace. &quot;One may conclude that this Israeli government has no strategy for peace and that it has chosen, as it appears, the path of confrontation,&quot; Shara said. &quot;The path of confrontation is however very costly...because Israel can start a war whenever it chooses, but it cannot end it as it chooses,&quot; he said. Syria, a key player in the Middle East peace process, is not involved in the Washington summit which has brought together Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat. Last week, Shara said the violent clashes between Israelis and Palestinians showed the whole peace process was dying. He did not repeat that on Wednesday, but accused the Israeli government of trying &quot;to demolish all the achievements of the past five years&quot;. He quoted Syrian President Hafez al-Assad as saying he did not believe there was &quot;any window for a just and comprehensive peace&quot; if Israel stuck to its current policies. Syria wants the return of the Golan, seized by Israel in 1967, as the main condition for making peace with the Jewish state.
M14,M141,MCAT	 Coffee prices resumed their climb on Friday, raising prospects of dearer cups of coffee as European roasters hiked retail prices to make up for soaring bean costs. Bean prices are already up by 32 percent since the start of the New Year and traders said the market looked poised for further gains after recent consolidation. London March robusta coffee futures prices surged to a high of $1,628 a tonne on Friday, just short of five-month peaks of $1,630 set on January 23, on fresh investor short-covering. But the contract's rally was shortlived, falling back to $1,540 by the close for a $14 loss. Traders however said the short-term uptrend remained intact. Fundamentally, the market remained firm boosted by worries of lower central American supplies and amid forecasts of lower 1997/98 Brazilian harvest. Coffee stocks in both producing and origin countries are also low. Western manufacturers had been running down on stocks since the Brazilian frosts in 1994 pushed prices to 10-year highs. Coffee drinkers will now have to pay for roasters' stock-keeping policy. Roasters, caught by the sudden hike in bean prices, scrambled to rebuild their supplies. But with the 32 percent hike in raw material costs, many would have no choice but to pass some of the costs to consumers. Large German roaster Kraft Jacobs Suchard is the latest firm to announce a retail price hike, announcing on Friday that it would have to offset the surge in futures prices and the dollar. Dutch roaster Douwe Egberts also toook a similar action earlier this week but Nestle UK, part of the Swiss food conglomerate, reiterated on Friday it had no immediate plans to raise retail prices but was watching the situation very closely. Despite the hike in bean prices, major producers said they would not like to see prices rising to levels that would deter consumer demand. The head of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries Rubens Barbosa said that the group would like to maintain a policy of stabilising prices at renumerative levels. &quot;As far as the ACPC is concerned we are not looking for sky-high prices,&quot; Barbosa said. &quot;It is neither in the interest of the consumers nor the producers to have boom and bust cycles agains,&quot; he told Reuters in an interview. ACPC countries agreed additional cuts in exports of robusta and arabica coffee totalling 1.3 million bags in the first six months of 1997, aiming to narrow the premium of New York-traded arabica over London's robusta. Barbosa denied comments that ACPC's export retention programme may have backfired, threatening consumer demand, saying the price spike was a result of changes in fundamental conditions. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 4985
GCAT,GDIP,GPOL	 Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp on Sunday condemned Beijing's plan to dilute civil liberties in the territory after it returns to Chinese rule this year. &quot;The scrapping of the provisions will seriously dampen Hong Kong people's rights of freedom of speech, assembly, protesting and demonstrations,&quot; Democratic Party vice-chairman Yeung Sum was quoted as saying in the English-language Hong Kong Standard. The 150-member China-appointed Preparatory Committee, which is overseeing Hong Kong's transition to Chinese rule, on Saturday approved a Beijing plan to roll back civil liberties in the territory after it takes over on July 1. The proposal would amend the territory's Bill of Rights Ordinance and repeal a number of other laws allowing public protests and association with foreign political organisations. Yeung said his party, which holds the most seats in Hong Kong's current elected Legislative Council, would introduce a motion in the legislature condemning the Preparatory Committee's decision. Independent legislator Emily Lau urged Chinese leaders on Sunday to take a more &quot;relaxed attitude&quot; toward Hong Kong, blaming China's moves to exert more control over the territory on leadership wrangling in Beijing. &quot;With the post-Deng Xiaoping transition still in a state of flux, apparently there are no strong leaders in Beijing who dare to take a relaxed attitude,&quot; Lau told the Hong Kong government radio. &quot;Consequently, they all would rather err on the side of being over-cautious. Thus, they would have maximum control,&quot; she said. Hong Kong, ending more than a century and a half of colonial rule, will return to Chinese control on July 1. China has promised Hong Kong that the territory will maintain a high degree of autonomy and keep its capitalist way of life intact for 50 years after the handover. Lau also called on the territory's future leader, Tung Chee-hwa, to &quot;learn to speak for the Hong Kong people rather than to be just a mouthpiece of Beijing&quot;. The Preparatory Committee's proposal will now go to China's National People's Congress, or parliament, for ratification in March.
M11,MCAT	 Most Estonian stocks rebounded on Thursday as trading picked up and the index rose with dealers saying that this meant that foreign and local investors had turned their attention back to the Estonian market. The Tallinn stock exchange index rose 3.35 percent to close at 178.97 on turnover of 52.3 million kroons. &quot;Investors eyes were turned away from the Estonian stock exchange and they are now back again,&quot; Riho Talumaa from investment house Talinvest said. Another dealer agreed that investors who went to the Latvian and Lithuanian bourses and sparked big gains were back. &quot;There was more foreign investor interest today, but towards the end there was a some profit taking, so tomorrow morning remains open,&quot; he added. Most stocks rose during the day. Savings Bank led the market in trade with 16.2 million kroons changing hands to close up 5.41 at 85.81 kroons. Hansapank made spectular gains to close 12.50 kroons up at 185 kroons after 13.1 million kroons of shares turned over. Forekspank's volume was down to 9.1 million kroons but its share price increased by 8.95 kroons to 144.95 kroons. Tallinna Pank rose three kroons to close at 67.00 kroons with 8.9 million kroons of shares traded. Union Bank stocks surged 5.75 kroons or 15.05 percent to close at 43.95 kroons on light trade of 2.9 million kroons. Dealers said that the Estonian would continue to face competition from Latvia and Lithuania. &quot;The Latvia and Lithuanian stock exchanges will stay attractive because they have relatively low prices and a larger number of stocks,&quot; Riho added. Over-the-counter trade almost doubled to a volume of 19.6 million kroons. Both the Kalev confectionary factory and the Rakvere meat plant were the market leaders. Rakvere was up 1.70 kroons to 14.80 after turning over 7.8 million kroons. Kalev volume was high at 7.8 million kroons to climb to 1,300 kroons, up 150 kroons. -- Riga Newsroom, +371 721 5240
M12,MCAT	 SIMEX Euroyen and Japanese government bond (JGB) futures were down but off their lows after comments by a Bank of Japan (BOJ) official triggered a late afternoon sell-off, dealers said on Tuesday. Masayuki Matsushima, director of the BOJ's research and statistics department, said the market did not always move in line with fundamentals. &quot;The market sometimes overshoots,&quot; he said. Matsushima also said the impact of a planned rise in Japan's consumption tax to five percent from three percent on April 1 was likely to be relatively mild.   Dealers said the comments triggered speculation that the BOJ may be preparing to change its easy monetary policy stance as early as April. &quot;Today we just melted down. A lot of people were caught out on long positions and sent scrambling,&quot; said a dealer at a European futures house. He said JGBs had been in strong demand in recent days as investors bought them to fulfil portfolio requirements ahead of the cash bond's last trading day for delivery in the current financial year.   The Japanese Finance Ministry announcement early in the day that it would announce measures to boost land liquidity on March 31 and continued market talk of the securities transaction tax being eventually scrapped also weighed on the market. &quot;All these things just ganged up against the fixed interest rate market,&quot; the trader said. But he said the move had been exaggerated by a thin market as Japanese players stayed out ahead of the financial year end on March 31. &quot;I don't think this points to any change in fundamentals,&quot; he said.   December Euroyen was quoted at 99.11 at 1120 GMT after hitting a low of 99.08 against its IMM close at 99.19. June JGBs settled at 125.92 against their previous 126.59. A Japanese bank dealer said December Euroyen was likely to be supported at 99.05. Eurodollar futures ended easier ahead of the release of U.S. housing starts data and the Consumer Price Index on Wednesday. Dealers said overnight comments by San Francisco Federal Reserve President Robert Parry that it was essential for the Fed to be forward looking in its fight against inflation contributed to market jitters about an interest rate hike later this month.
GCAT,GVIO	 A special U.N. envoy arrived in eastern Zaire on Sunday to assess how to stop fighting between the Zaire army and ethnic Tutsis. &quot;I am sent here as a special envoy of the United Nations Secretary General to try and find out as much as possible about the situation here on the ground,&quot; envoy Ibrahima Fall told reporters as he arrived in Bukavu. &quot;I will be meeting with the local administration but also with as many other actors in the area as possible.&quot; Asked if his brief was to stop the conflict drawing in the armies of Rwanda and Burundi, both dominated by Tutsis, Fall said: &quot;If I am able to, so much the better.&quot; As the envoy flew into Bukavu from the Zaire capital Kinshasa, aid workers said Banyamulenge Tutsi rebels had cut a section of the highway between Bukavu and Uvira. Aid workers in Uvira also said many people had been killed and wounded in renewed fighting between the Zairean military and Banyamulenge rebels in north Uvira.
GCAT,GSCI	 NASA managers ruled out a space walk from the shuttle Columbia on Friday so engineers can continue to study the jammed hatch that blocked Thursday night's planned outing by two astronauts. Tammy Jernigan and Tom Jones were to have spent 6 1/2-hours space walking on Thursday night to practice space station construction but they were unable to turn the handle that opens the hatch leading into the shuttle's cargo bay. &quot;The mission mangement team concluded that no spacewalk should be attempted tonight while engineers continue to evaluate the problem and work to develop a list of options,&quot; said NASA commentator Kari Fluegel. If a solution is found a space walk could be attempted as early as Saturday, she said. Mission managers planned to meet again at 9 a.m. EST (1300 GMT) on Saturday. NASA managers and engineeers at the Johnson Space Centre, home to NASA's mission control, in Houston, Texas, pored over television pictures of the hatch's latching mechanism on Friday, looking for signs of trouble. &quot;At this time we're still just investigating everything and just to let you know where we're at, at this point... we certainly don't see anything obvious jumping out at us,&quot; spacecraft communicator Kay Hire told Jernigan on Friday morning. &quot;We appreciate being kept up to date on what you all are thinking,&quot; replied Jernigan. &quot;We've certainly taken a hard look... and didn't see anything up here either.&quot; The astronauts ran into trouble when they tried to open the hatch at around 9:15 p.m. EST Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). They tugged at the handle, tried getting extra leverage by putting their feet on the ceiling, and fitted a new handle -- all without success. At one point mission control even asked them to check whether they were turning the handle in the right direction. &quot;We apologise for recommending the obvious, but please confirm that you are going in a clockwise direction,&quot; spacecraft communicator Bill McArthur said. The two dejected astronauts hung up their space suits for the day after struggling with the stubborn handle for over two hours. NASA officials offered little hope of a finding a solution because most of the latching mechanism is located on the exterior of the hatch and cannot be reached by the crew. &quot;We are rather limited in what we can do from inside the airlock,&quot; flight director Rob Kelso told a news conference early Friday. It was only the second time in the 15-year shuttle programme that NASA has been forced to cancel a space walk. The last occasion, in 1983, was because of space suit problems. But the space walk would have been the first ever from Columbia, the oldest member of NASA's space shuttle fleet. The mishap did let the two would-be space walkers and Columbia's three other astronauts get an early start on a Thanksgiving meal they had not expected to eat until after the space walk. &quot;Today didn't go exactly as we'd hoped,&quot; said shuttle commander Ken Cockrell, as his crew ate their NASA-issue, shelf-stabilised turkey steaks. &quot;We've got high hopes for tomorrow and the rest of this flight... we still have a lot to be thankful for.&quot; The astronauts were supposed to make two space walks to test an 18-foot (six-meter) -long, manually operated crane and other tools need for the construction of the U.S.-led, 13-nation project, which starts next November. &quot;We feel quite strongly that these are two very important (space walks),&quot; said Jerry Ross, an astronaut assigned to the first space station assembly mission. &quot;I'm not prepared to say, however, if we didn't do these two (space walks) we wouldn't be ready to start.&quot; Columbia was due to return to earth at the Kennedy Space Centre on Dec 5.
C11,C23,CCAT	 Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd president Tadashi Nishimoto said on Thursday that KDD would not join Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp cellular unit NTT DoCoMo's effort to develop a next generation cellular phone standard using wide band CDMA technology.   &quot;KDD is engaged in the development of its own technology and we have no plans to join NTT DoCoMo's efforts,&quot; Nishimoto told a news conference. &quot;Our business will be at a disadvantage if we adopt the same standard as NTT DoCoMo.&quot; Asked about the impact of Japan's planned deregulation of leased lines in December, Nishimoto said: &quot;We can fully compete with our rivals if a level playing field is secured.&quot; The Japanese government currently imposes stricter rules on the setting of rates for KDD and other telecom firms that own facilities in Japan than for those that do not own infrastructure. KDD also announced that it has formed a wholly owned telecom consulting company in Shanghai with a total investment of $1 million. The unit, which will support construction of telecom networks, aims for 200 million yen in sales in five years' time.
GCAT,GPOL,GVOTE	 The single most popular outcome of this year's elections in Poland would be a centre-left coalition straddling divisions that date back to the communist era, an opinion poll published on Tuesday showed. The poll, for the daily Gazeta Wyborcza, showed 21 percent of voters wanted a government linking the now-ruling Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) of former communists and two opposition parties rooted in the struggle that toppled communism in 1989. The SLD and a peasant party, also descended from the former communist system, are now in an uneasy governing coalition but only 10 percent of those polled wanted this pact to continue after the elections which are due around September. The ex-communists would love to lure one or more parties led by former democracy campaigners into an coalition, which would help them shed the stigma of their origins. The two parliamentary opposition parties, the centrist Union for Freedom (UW) and the left-wing Labour Union (UP) share similar secular views and some key policies with the SLD. But they have resisted any deal with the ex-communists before the elections as this could harm their cause by association -- especially as the SLD continues to stall initiatives aimed at redressing past wrongs. The 21 percent support for a coalition of the three parties, reported in the May 17-19 survey of 1,060 adults by the PBS polling agency, may provide arguments for a &quot;historic compromise&quot; between communists and some of their old foes. Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, a former communist, welcomed the poll result, saying similarities of policies were more important than old emnities. &quot;I think the Polish political scene is to a large extent split irrationally, ever more so as we draw ever further from 1989,&quot; he told private Radio Zet in an interview. He said his party had not made any deals with the two opposition groupings but he was in touch with them. PBS said the second most favoured option, backed by 15 percent, would be a broad coalition of parties stemming from the pre-1989 democracy struggle -- the trade-union led Solidarity Election Action (AWS), the radical rightist Movement for the Reconstruction of Poland (ROP) and the UW. Such a coalition would appeal to people who continue to reject the ex-communists while the presence of the UW, led by the architects of Poland's liberal reforms, would guarantee continued pro-market policies and temper any radicalism. Of those polled, 12 percent favoured a Solidarity-ROP alliance and only five percent wanted a coalition embracing these two parties and the Peasants. A possible coalition of Peasants, Labour Union and Union for Freedom attracted six percent support. The poll, the third such monthly survey, showed a rise in support for the &quot;historic compromise&quot; option of the SLD with the UW and UP which was supported by 18 percent in April. This increase could be linked to a joint campaign waged by the three parties for Poland's new constitution which was narrowly adopted in a May 25 referendum. The issue of likely coalitions is crucial as the two election front-runners, the SLD and the AWS, both now appear likely to gain about 30 percent of seats each and will have to form alliances with other parties in order to govern.
C18,C181,C24,CCAT	 Lion Asiapac Ltd on Monday unveiled details of its proposed motorcycle business acquisition in China and plans to streamline its loss-making container making business. Managing director Sam Chong-Keen told a news conference the group's dry container manufacturing operations in Malaysia would be consolidated into a single plant in Penang, Malaysia. He said the other Malaysian plant at Port Klang was occupying &quot;valuable real estate&quot; and the group planned to maximise returns from the site. The consolidation will be effective end 1997, Sam said.   He also gave details on the group's proposed acquisition of a motorcycle business in China from Lion Holdings, the parent of Lion Asiapac and the privately-held investment vehicle of Malaysian tycoon, William Cheng. Lion Asiapac plans to pay US$34.7 million (S$48.6 million) for the acquisition, which is conditional upon shareholders' approval on April 15, Sam said. The purchase price is based on what Lion Holdings has invested in the Chinese ventures, plus interest.   The joint venture company has enjoyed tax concession for 1995 and 1996 where no income tax was payable, and will start paying tax of 16.5 percent from 1997 to 1999. Sam said the motorcycle business in China was extremely competitive, with over 300 producers. The group sold 191,305 motorcycle units in 1996, about 11 percent lower than 1995. Sam said the lower output was due to some plant disruptions in the second half of last year and keen competition. He said the group was looking to export some of the production.   The China motorcycle business comprises four companies which have entered into joint ventures with Zhejiang Qianjiang Motorcycle Group Corp, which is wholly-owned by the Wenliang City Government in China. The joint venture company in China is one of the top 15 motorcycle producers in the country, Sam said. The joint venture companies registered sales of S$166.5 million and pre-tax profits of S$18.5 million in year ended December 31 1996.   &quot;One area of growth would be to export the motorcycles. Currently the motorcycles are being sold in Columbia and Bangladesh,&quot; Sam said. The group plans to explore opportunities in Indo-China and parts of Southeast Asia where there are no high tariff barriers, he said. -- Singapore newsroom (65 8703080)
M12,MCAT	 Israeli bonds closed higher across the board in thin trading on Sunday ahead of the release of November's consumer price index (CPI), traders said. Announced after the close of trading, the CPI rose 0.6 percent against a rise of 0.8 percent in October. Indices: * Government bonds general: +0.12 to 171.05 * CPI-linked government bonds: +0.12 to 171.76 * Dollar-linked government bonds: +0.19 pct to 169.92 * Unlinked government bonds (Gilon -- issued for four years): +0.10 pct to 172.07 * Bank of Israel short-term Makam bills: +0.10 pct to 162.28 Volume was very low at 97 million shekels. &quot;Activity was very low. The market was indifferent to the release of the CPI as investors were predicting a moderate rise of 0.6 to 0.7 percent,&quot; said Zvi Hoffman at Meitav Investments and Securities. &quot;The main reason for the rise in CPI-linked bonds was that the big institutional investors have increased liquidity before the end-of-the-year and they are looking now for investments,&quot; Hoffman said. Provident funds usually enjoy an inlfux of new money towards the end of the year for tax reasons. &quot;Unlinked bonds rose slightly as their prices declined because of profit-taking on Wednesday and Thursday. The moderate rise of the CPI is seen as a very good sign and unlinked bonds are expected to rise further on Monday,&quot; said Ronen Kaufman at Nesuah Trading and Investments. Makams rose moderately on very low volume of 25 million shekels. Traders said dollar-linked bonds rose sharply but on turnover of only 3,000 shekels. Note: Makams are zero-coupon unlinked certificates with durations of three months to one year. The Bank of Israel issues Makams to absorb liquidity.

C22,CCAT	 CNN Interactive, the Internet arm of Time Warner Inc.'s 24-hour news operation, and database software maker Oracle Corp. next week will unveil an interactive news site, according to sources close to the companies. Time Warner Vice Chairman Ted Turner and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison are scheduled to make a joint keynote address at the Comdex/Spring trade show in Atlanta on Wednesday. Neither CNN Interactive nor Oracle would comment on the proposed venture. But sources close to the companies said Oracle will provide CNN's existing Web site with technology for advanced text and data searching and streaming video, in which a user can click on an icon on the site and see video of an event. The site will compete with MSNBC, the joint venture by General Electric Co.'s NBC television network and software giant Microsoft Corp.; and Walt Disney Co.'s ABCNEWS.com, which is distributed by its partners: the America Online Inc. online service and Internet software maker Netscape Communications Corp. The sources were not sure if Oracle will add its brand to the CNN site or if it will simply supply technology. CNN operates several 24-hour cable news channels, and promotes its Web site in its programming. The venture would be the latest attempt by media companies to increase their presence on the Web. CBS has said it will unveil its plans to enter the Internet arena later this month. In April, the network purchased a 22 percent stake in Internet SportsLine USA, a provider of sports information and scores.
M11,M13,M132,M14,M142,MCAT	 The dollar surged above 1.67 marks on Tuesday as the German currency took a fresh battering from renewed concerns about the German economy and unemployment. In late European business the dollar was quoted at around 1.6720, off its 1.6735 high for the day -- a near 32-month peak -- but well above its 1.6571 close on Monday. Meanwhile European bourses had a lacklustre day, dragged down in the morning by a 49-point fall on Wall Street overnight and drawing little comfort from a higher opening in New York on Tuesday. The Dow was around half a percentage point higher when European markets closed. The dollar was the main focus. It appeared to have completely shrugged off weekend signals from the Group of Seven (G7) industrialised nations that it had risen far enough. Many in the market saw the G7 comments as tilted more toward dollar/yen than dollar/mark. Unless they hear otherwise from the authorities, investors will persist in their pursuit of a higher dollar against European currencies, analysts said. &quot;At this point, the market is looking at how far this can go, while testing the resolve of the central banks,&quot; said Jeremy Stretch, currency strategist at NatWest Markets. &quot;The pressure's very much been on the mark today with last week's German jobless scare coming home to haunt it,&quot; he added. And Tony Norfield, treasury economist at ABN Amro in London, commented: &quot;The message coming through is that there is the beginning of some panic about the unexpected weakness of the German economy.&quot; Against the yen the dollar remained relatively calm all day at around 122.90, little firmer than its close on Monday . London, Europe's busiest bourse, closed down just 3.4 points on the key FTSE 100 index, off its lows after a trading day dominated by the strength of sterling -- which touched a 52-month high of 2.7460 marks. The pound's strength was seen weighing on corporate results, some of which were disappointing. Shares in BP and Reuters eased after profits were in line with forecasts. French stocks finished slightly weaker in a consolidation prompted by Wall Street's drop on Monday but bid speculation enlivened trading in financial shares, traders said. They said the bourse was underpinned by the strong performances of the bond markets and the dollar and a partial rebound on Wall Street in early trading but many said a consolidation of the Paris market was welcome and overdue. Frankfurt was an exception, where the stronger dollar -- favourable for German exports -- outweighed the overnight New York weakness and stocks closed bourse trading slightly higher. Its DAX index of leading shares closed up 3.22 points at 3,187.58 after a day of low trading volumes due to Tuesday being a half-day pre-Lent holiday. CURRENCIES AT 1645 GMT The dollar was quoted at 1.6720 marks and 122.90 yen compared with 1.6571 marks and 122.83 yen in late European trading on Monday STOCK MARKETS CLOSING INDICES LONDON - The FTSE-100 index closed down 3.4 at 4,304.3.

FRANKFURT - The 30-share DAX index closed up 3.22 at 3,187.58 PRECIOUS METALS Gold closed at $339.50 compared with its close in London on Monday of $341.30. Silver ended at $4.93.
M11,MCAT	 A weak opening on Wall Street dragged UK stocks of their day's highs by the close on Thursday after a day in which the market continued to be gripped by nervousness following the share losses of recent sessions. After rising 27 points at one stage, the FTSE 100 closed just 8.2 points higher at 3,990.7 British Gas, B.A.T and AB Foods were among the biggest gainers on year-end bargain-hunting. With weak gilts also weighing on shares, traders said fears of a further shakeout in U.S. stocks were likely to hamstring the UK market for some time yet.
M14,M141,MCAT	 CME lean hog and pork belly futures were again influenced by Friday's Hogs and Pigs report in back months but nearbys closed lower on profit taking, traders said. Hogs closed 1.025 cent per lb lower to 0.725 higher with July off most at 83.650 cents. Only October to February contracts posted gains. Pork bellies ended 0.550 lower to 1.500 higher with July off most at 84.675 cents and next year contracts higher. Profit taking developed in both pits as the hog report is now priced in after Monday's limit gains, traders said. &quot;We had a lower (than expected) breeding herd number and we priced that back in,&quot; said Jim Clarkson with A and A Inc of Friday's USDA hog report. The USDA reported that hogs kept for breeding were up one percent from a year ago, well under analysts' pre-report estimates that breeding hogs would be up three to six percent. October to February contracts were also underpinned the pig crop number at 102 percent versus a 103.8 percent estimate. This will cut the number of hogs that will be marketed in the third and fourth quarters from previous projections, they said. Nearby contracts retreated as the report still showed a two percent expansion in the overall hog herd from a year earlier. Cooler and less humid weather should also allow larger hog marketings Wednesday which could weigh on immediate cash hog prices, some sources noted.   Rand Financials sold July and August late. Prudential Securities bought August while locals sold both months and Lind-Waldock pressured August, pit sources said. In hog options, volatility was falling as futures traded lower than expected. Rand sold October 76 calls early while commission houses sold August 84 calls and October 74 to 82 calls, pit sources added. Pork belly futures showed an extremely wide trading range early with February posting both a limit gain of 3.000 cents and a limit loss of 3.000 cents. Prices finally finished mixed with nearbys down on profit taking, traders said. As in hog futures, nearbys appeared overbought after the report but deferreds again were supported by the USDA data. August fell the daily limit after starting sharply higher on carryover buy stops and March posted a limit gain before the profit taking cut gains, they said. The belly market is expected to remain nervous after the CME out-of-town report which was released after the close of trading on Tuesday. The CME reported a net out-movement of 1.179 million lbs versus 972,000 lb out last year. The out-movement was above trade expectations. R.J. O'Brien bought late. E.D.&amp;F. Man a notable seller early and Dean Witter actively bought July and August on the early break, pit sources said. ((Jerry Bieszk 312-408-8725))
C15,C151,C1511,CCAT	 McDonnell Douglas Corp said Thursday its firm backlog stood at $23.7 billion on December 31, up from $19.6 billion a year earlier. Total backlog was $44.4 billion on December 31, up from $28.4 billion a year earlier. The company said the rise in firm backlog related to the Longbow Apache helicopter program and to finalizing terms for the next eight C-17 military cargo aircraft.   The rise in total backlog related largely to multi-year contracts on the C-17 and Longbow Apache programs and, to a lesser extent, increases in the International Space Station and F/A-18 military aircraft programs. McDonnell Douglas today improved fourth quarter results. Operating earnings for the full year 1996 were a record $1.36 billion, up from $1.20 billion in 1995.   &quot;McDonnell Douglas's record 1996 performance was paced by continued strong results in our military aircraft segment,&quot; Harry Stonecipher, president, said in a statement. Operating earnings in the military aircraft segment were $990 million in 1996, a record high, compared with $905 million in 1995, the previous record. Military aircraft operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $244 million, down from $253 million in the 1995 quarter. Military aircraft revenues were $8.0 billion for 1996, down from $8.2 billion in 1995, and $2.1 billion for the fourth quarter, down from $2.2 billion a year earlier. Operating margins for 1996 improved to over 12 percent from 11 percent in 1995. A 99-day strike at the St. Louis facilities, which ended in mid-September, reduced revenues in the 1996 fourth quarter, the company said. ((-- Chicago Newsdesk (312) 408-8787))

C21,C24,CCAT	 Jiangxi Copper Company Ltd, China's largest copper cathode producer, said on Wednesday it had completed procedures to boost its capacity to 150,000 tonnes in 1998 from 120,000 tonnes this year. The Phase II expansion project, located in Guixi in southeast China's Jiangxi province, involved development of a 10,000 cubic metre oxygen generator which would boost smelting capacity, the company said in a statement. The expansion cost 1.53 billion yuan and involved the installation of two anode furnaces and an ingot casting plant. The remainder of the Phase II expansion would be completed by 1999 and raise copper cathode production to 200,000 tonnes a year by the year 2000. The expansion would be financed partly by the proceeds from the company's listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and in London on June 13. Jiangxi Copper produced 116,547 of copper cathode in 1996 and its Guiye brand copper is the only Grade A copper produced in China and registered with the London Metal Exchange. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843 6358

GCAT,GCRIM	 Serbia's priority task will be to clamp down on crime and the booming grey economy, the republican government said in a statement carried by Belgrade newspapers Thursday. &quot;The government's priority task is to fight against crime and the grey economy which are reflected in the illegal flow of goods into the country and illicit domestic trade of goods, primarily those subject to excise duties,&quot; the government said. It listed oil, oil derivatives, cigarettes, coffee and alcoholic drinks among goods on which excise duties are not being paid. The government said it would launch a campaign to eradicate this &quot;most serious form of crime&quot; and to pursue those who make high &quot;illegal profits&quot; and undermine the entire economic and social order by avoiding payment of legally regulated taxes. The Serbian government adopted a series of measures with this aim, coordinating the work of all federal and republican bodies fighting crime and suppressing the grey economy, the statement said. It called on legislative bodies to be more efficient in finding and punishing those involved in illegal activities. In an economy devastated by the breakup of the former Yugoslav federation and 3-1/2 years of war-related international sanctions, hundreds of thousands of people turned to the black market for a livelihood. Domestic producers accuse the government of not being rigorous enough against the booming illegal trade which has drastically cut down on their sales. The government's frequent promises to clamp down on black marketeers have not materialised. According to some analysts the grey economy accounts for up to 50 percent of Yugoslavia's Gross Domestic Product. -- Beti Bilandzic, Belgrade newsroom +381 11 222 4305
C11,CCAT	 Trimark Holdings Inc said Monday it retained investment bank Societe Generale Bannon, to advise the company on various strategic alternatives to help enhance shareholder value. &quot;Recent acquisitions in the entertainment industry have left Trimark in a unique position as the leading independent producer and distributor of specialized theatrical, television and video product.&quot; said chairman Mark Amin. &quot;This has resulted in the company attracting an unusually high number of unsolicited inquiries from interested parties. In order to minimize management's distraction from the day-to-day operations of the company, Trimark has hired an investment banker to assist in evaluating strategic opportunities that are periodically presented to the company.&quot; The company said in a release it expects to generate &quot;excellent cash flow&quot; in the quarter ending Sept. 30, 1997, based on the successful video release of &quot;Meet Wally Sparks,&quot; the approximately $7 million and $4 million domestic box office generated respectively by &quot;Sprung&quot; and the specialized film &quot;Kama Sutra:  A Tale of Love,&quot; and the line-up of quality theatrical and video product set for distribution.

When asked by Reuters whether the plan was adopted in response to a particular attempt to take control of the company, a spokeswoman said, &quot;Our policy does not allow us to comment on those types of questions.&quot; The rights will be exercisable only if certain persons or groups acquire or begin a tender offer for beneficial ownership of 10 percent or more of the company's outstanding common stock. Under the plan, preferred stock purchase rights will be distributed as a dividend at the rate of one right for each share of common stock held as of the close of business on July 14, 1997.
C31,CCAT	 Tractebel SA made its first trade in the U.S. power market last month, becoming the first European utility in the market, chief executive Baron Philippe Bodson told a news conference. The company's new trading subsidiary, Tractebel Energy Marketing Inc, officially began operation April 1, a full week after its first electricity trade, according to the new unit's trading chief, William L. Coorsh. Tractabel is &quot;the first continental utility to be involved in U.S. energy marketing,&quot; Baron Bodson said.   As a result, the company expects to &quot;be very well positioned&quot; when power trading starts in Europe, he said. He does not expect natural gas trading in Europe, stating &quot;the dream of competition in Europe is the dream of the European commission&quot; because of the limited number of suppliers. Trading volume for the recently initiated natural gas futures contract on London's International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) has been thin. With four natural gas suppliers, Baron Badson explained, &quot;one can corner the market.&quot;   Tractabel chose to start a trading firm from scratch instead of acquiring an existing firm &quot;because it is a lot cheaper,&quot; explained Wim Heyselberghs, senior vice president of distribution operations for Tractebel Electricity and Gas International. He said the new firm will market and trade electricity, natural gas and fuel oil at both the wholesale and retail levels &quot;mainly in the U.S. Northeast and eastern Canada.&quot; That's where another Tractabell subsidiary, CRSS Inc, has most of its non-utility power plants, he noted. By year end, Heyselberghs said, Tractebel Energy Marketing will have 20 employees in offices in Houston, Boston and Montreal. The new units' objective is &quot;not maximum volume,&quot; he said, but to be the &quot;most profitable&quot; trader. Tractebel officials declined to discuss the company's profit and volume goals.

E12,ECAT,GCAT,GPOL	 When President Boris Yeltsin addresses parliament in the Kremlin on Thursday, his ministers will be listening especially closely to see whether their mixed economic record leads to a major cabinet reshuffle. Last week Yeltsin criticised the government for failing to pay billions of dollars in back wages and pensions, and said some changes in the cabinet were needed, igniting speculation that even Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin himself could go. Various unions are planning a nationwide protest on March 27 about wage arrears, and workers at the giant Norilsk Nickel group have already agreed a strike plan. Chernomyrdin, a stolid, uncharismatic figure, is widely viewed in the West as a guarantor of stability and continuing reforms, and his departure would unsettle foreign investors. But his government's economic record is mixed. Former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, who as Chernomyrdin's predecessor launched economic reforms in 1992, says the government has failed to tackle wage arrears and other issues. &quot;The government formed after Boris Yeltsin's victory in the presidential election last summer had a unique chance to start serious systematic reforms,&quot; Gaidar said last month. &quot;This government will not have such a chance again.&quot; Russian reforms and the creation of a market economy have led to fabulous wealth for a few. Millions more enjoy living standards vastly higher than five years ago. But for most people, like the drab passengers crammed on the escalators of the Moscow metro, listening to advertisements for holidays in Tahiti, life is just more expensive and much harder. &quot;Hyperinflation has been broken but it has been broken in a context which has created massive inequalities of wealth, enormous cynicism and enormous corruption. Russia has a lot of cleaning up to do to become a normal country,&quot; said Harvard economics professor Jeffrey Sachs, a former adviser to the Russian government. The achievements of the Chernomyrdin government are clear. A massive privatisation programme, the greatest transfer of property in peacetime, launched under Gaidar, has rolled on. Inflation has been virtually tamed, coming down from over 25 percent a month when Chernomyrdin was appointed in December 1992 to one or two percent a month now. The rouble, once a byword for a collapsing currency, has steadied, and foreigners are pouring billions of dollars into government bonds, driving interest rates down below 30 percent. And Russia is creditworthy, returning to international capital markets with a heavily oversubscribed debut Eurobond. But these successes have had a price. In many cases privatisation handed ownership of enterprises to the former communist managers. World-class oil and metals companies have been handed over to a small coterie of banks with links to the government in a process which critics say was opaque at best if not corrupt. The government has failed to ensure that companies pay their taxes in full and on time, leaving it short of resources. To stop the shortfall in tax revenues swelling the budget deficit and re-igniting inflation, the government has had to slash spending, including public-sector wages. Outstanding wage arrears at the end of January were 48.60 trillion roubles ($8.5 billion), with 9.48 trillion owed by the government, while 31.9 million people or 22 percent of the population had incomes less than the 394,000 roubles ($70) a month which the government estimates is necessary to survive. Much legislation vital for a market economy is still not in place, including a promised new tax code. And despite repeated promises that recovery is imminent, the economy has continued to contract. Industrial output has halved since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991. The failure to impose a proper legal framework, guaranteeing property rights and the rule of law, means Russia has attracted only $6.6 billion in foreign direct investment since 1991. But money is beginning to come in. Germany's biggest bank, Deutsche Bank AG, which plans to open a subsidiary in Russia this year, says it is aware of the economic problems. &quot;On the other hand it's unmistakable that the stabilisation process is continuing, especially in the financial sector,&quot; Deutsche management board member Georg Krupp said. &quot;We are convinced that the road Russia has set off on is irreversible.&quot; ($1=5678 roubles)
C15,C151,CCAT	 RTW Inc said Monday its first quarter earnings fell from a year ago because of competition, as well as costs of expansion in new and existing markets. The company said it is seeing continued premium rate competition, but indications are that rates are stabilizing. Costs per claim continued to remain stable or decrease slightly, but the lower premiums caused the loss ratio for the workers compensation company to increase. The expansion resulted in commissions that were higher than historical levels. The company said it expects those higher commission levels to continue in the foreseeable future. The company said it has made significant progress in decreasing claim and settlement expenses in Colorado and that it has not experienced any adverse developments with regard to the four large claims that it experienced in the fourth quarter of 1996. Earlier Monday, the company reported net income of $1.3 million or $0.11 a share in the first quarter, compared to $2.3 million, or $0.19 a share, a year ago. ((Chicago newsdesk, 312-408-8787))

C21,C24,CCAT,GCAT,GWEA	 A cold, snowy weekend hampered livestock movement in parts of Minnesota and Iowa but meteorologists said the worst weather has passed. &quot;Anywhere from four to eight inches of snow fell there over the weekend and behind that snow this morning, you're looking at sub-zero (Farenheit) temperatures,&quot; said Mike Palmerino, meteorologist with Weather Services Corp. &quot;Things will get back to normal in terms of being able to transport the animals off to market in the next few days,&quot; he added. &quot;It's going to stay cold although it will likely not be as cold in the coming days as it is this morning.&quot;   The low temperature in Sioux Falls, S.D. on Monday was 12 degrees below zero F, about 30 degrees below normal, said Fred Gesser, chief forecaster with Weather Express. &quot;We had single digits (temperatures) all the way down to Kansas,&quot; Gesser said. He said temperatures would warm gradually throughout the week with mostly dry conditions in the U.S. Plains but another storm was expected to drop more snow this weekend. &quot;We should have a cold week all the way into Thanksgiving (Thursday) with temperatures trying to warm up ahead of another system Friday and Saturday,&quot; Gesser said.   Palmerino said light snow was possible in the U.S. Plains on Wednesday but otherwise conditions were expected to be dry. &quot;We're not looking for too much in the way of additional major storms,&quot; Palmerino said. &quot;There is the potential that we could see a little bit of light snow or flurry activity in the western Corn Belt on Wednesday, continuing into Thursday. Snow was expected to move east across Ohio on Monday with two to four inches possible, Gesser said. --Emily Kaiser 312-408-8749

E51,E512,ECAT	 The U.S. trade gap remained surprisingly tight in April and economists said the data will prompt them to adjust second-quarter growth forecasts upward, even though the deficit widened slightly from March. &quot;It's a widening, but it's a low number. So the two months taken together show us that lately we've been doing very, very well and remain very competitive on world markets,&quot; said Russell Sheldon, senior economist at Mellon Bank. The U.S. international trade deficit stood at $8.36 billion in April, the Commerce Department said on Thursday.   The number was well below forecasts for a $10 billion gap but nonetheless showed a 7.8 percent rise from March, which was revised down to a slim $7.76 billion deficit from $8.51 billion originally reported. The data show that the U.S. economy has not cooled quite so much as many economists expected from its bubbly 5.8 percent annual rate of growth in the first quarter. A pick-up in economic activity overseas seemed to generate more demand for U.S. products, which is expected to underpin the net export component of U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP), economists said.   &quot;The trade numbers support the view that GDP in the second quarter is not going to be as quite as soft as people are assuming,&quot; said Astrid Adolfson, an economist at MCM MoneyWatch. Forecasters orginally eyeing sub-2.0 percent growth in the April-June period have again started talking about a tempo closer to the long-term sustainable average, generally considered a rate in the 2.0 to 2.5 percent range. &quot;We started up with 1.3 percent, so it might be a little stronger in second quarter,&quot; said Kathleen Stephansen, senior economist at Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp.   Exports rose 0.2 percent in April, to $78.36 billion, while imports rose a steeper 0.9 percent, to $86.72 billion. In April, the trade gap in goods rose to $15.11 billion from $14.88 billion in March. The surplus in services fell to $6.75 billion from $7.12 billion. Bilaterally, the trade deficit with key Asian nations rose. The gap with Japan was the widest, at $4.841 billion, having risen 5.1 percent from March. Against China, the deficit surged 33 percent to $3.451 billion. With West Europe, the U.S. moved from a $320 million surplus to a deficit of $486 million, a 252 percent swing.   The deficits with both North American trading partners, Canada and Mexico, fell. Many economists expected the strong dollar this year to wreak more havoc on the U.S. trade position, especially with Japan, which on Wednesday reported its trade surplus with the United States nearly doubled in May. But exports, particularly of high tech capital goods like computers, have proved resilient to the competitive handicap a stronger dollar imposes, economists said. &quot;Lately we've had some reversal in the dollar so that's not as much of problem as you thought it might be. And global economies are picking up very nicely, adding to strength which we see in the new orders for exports from the purchasing managers,&quot; Mellon's Sheldon said.

M14,M141,MCAT	 NYCE cotton futures weakened on persistent fund selling ahead of Friday's USDA supply and demand data. Trade buying supported the market at the lows. December ended down 0.83 cent at 75.40 cents a lb, having ranged from 76.40 and 75.16. The back months closed 0.80 to 0.40 lower. Volume was estimated at 7,000 lots. Market sources pegged the U.S. crop estimate between 18.2 million and 17.5 million 480-lb bales, compared with September's forecast of 17.9 million bales. While players do not expect the report to move prices dramatically, the market closed weaker on several pieces of bearish news. Imports for the week ended Oct 6 were only 13,437 bales, but cumulative imports reached 368,480. The USDA put imports at 500,000 for the season, an estimate that is likely to increase in Friday's USDA report, market sources said. Also, the USDA's weekly export report showing new sales of at 221,000 bales for the week, included two large and probably one-time purchases to Turkey and Mexico. Talk about the deteriorating quality of the U.S. crop continues to haunt the market as sluggish mill demand, illustrated by lower same-store sales data for September, also weighs on prices. &quot;There is just not a lot of demand from the consumer,&quot; said Sharon Johnson, an analyst with Frank Schneider and Co Inc. --Suzanne Rostler, New York Commodities 212-859-1646

British satellite pay-TV broadcaster BSkyB, in which Murdoch's News Corp owns 40 percent, has been promised a 25 percent stake in Premiere as part of Murdoch's alliance with Bavarian media mogul Leo Kirch. &quot;We already have a letter from the cartel office that they would block this,&quot; Bertelsmann board member Thomas Middelhoff told reporters.

C13,C21,C31,CCAT,M14,M141,MCAT	 Coffee producing nations led by Brazil began talks in London on Monday when they will discuss whether to suspend their export quotas to try to help cool an explosive rally in world prices. Some of the 14 members of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) worry that soaring prices - one U.S. futures contract hit a 20-year high last week - may erode demand for the beverage as people drink tea or soft drinks instead. &quot;It is not logical to keep the quota system right now,&quot; the chief delegate of Costa Rica, Ricardo Seevers, told reporters. As the talks began, London coffee futures extended the blistering rally that has seen prices roughly double since 1997 began, in the longest sustained rally for two decades. The July contract was up $125 at $2,180 per tonne within 20 minutes of the start of trading. A volatile mix of factors - low stocks, tight supply from Colombia and fears that Brazil may have another frost - has lured speculators to the futures markets. The London coffee talks opened with a session of an ACPC technical group of Brazil, Colombia, Ivory Coast, Indonesia, Uganda and El Salvador which will put forward proposals for a full meeting on Wednesday. The attitude of Brazil, the biggest seller, may be crucial to any decisions. But the Brazilian president of the ACPC, Rubens Barbosa, declined to make any comment to reporters on Monday morning. Indonesian delegates said it was necessary for the group to consider suspending quotas. Costa Rica's Seevers, attending the technical session as an observer, said this view was shared by Central American producers. Last week saw New York spot May futures for quality arabica beans trade at $2.79 per pound, the highest since June 1977. July, a more active and representative arabica contract, has more than doubled to reach $2.62 this year. Prices eased slightly late last weekon profit taking, dealers reported. The ACPC accounts for about 75 percent of world output. Quota rules now in force aim to cap its exports at 25.5 million bags in the first half of 1997. But at talks in March the members rescinded new cuts by 500,000 bags as the market tightened, even as some delegates now talk of suspending quotas altogether. A top official from Colombia hinted last week that he would be ready to put any extension of the export curbs beyond June 30 on hold. &quot;The producers' desire is to send a signal to the markets and there's no question of having prices at a certain level just for the sake of it or of creating artificial conditions,&quot; said Jorge Cardenas, veteran head of the Colombian Coffee Federation. Government officials said linchpin Brazil's position will only be defined during the London talks. But Gilson Ximenes, the president of the growers' Brazilian Coffee Council, said he was in favour of retained the current quota policy. Brazil is expected to exceed its quota for January-June by about 1.0 million bags but local exporters say there was a shortfall of 2.0 million in quotas in the previous programme. The French and British were last Friday the latest among consumers to be stung by new price rises in the shops. Douwe Egberts France, owned by Sara Lee Corp, said this year's French retail increases on its arabica coffees now totalled around 45 percent. French Cafes Excella SA said it planned new retail prices rises in June. But marketing director Jean-Jacques Dothee said he did not believe that futures reflected supply/demand fundamentals. &quot;There is no risk of a coffee shortage. We are being held hostage by a speculative game...&quot; he said. Dothee also gave a warning that high prices might scare away consumers, notably young people switching to soft drinks.

G152,G155	 The European Commission has agreed draft plans requiring EU countries to step up safety checks on commercial aircraft using their airports and to ground any found to be breaking international rules. &quot;The proposal was agreed yesterday...,&quot; a European Commission spokesman told Reuters on Tuesday. Proposals include draft rules for harmonised safety checks on third-country aircraft and a data-exchange system to alert other EU countries to the possible dangers posed by aircraft from any particular company or state. &quot;Recent experience has shown that carriers from third countries do not always apply the minimum international safety standards while having access to (European) Community airports,&quot; said a text of the proposal seen by Reuters. &quot;In order to address this problem, some member states already carry out ramp inspections of foreign aircraft but in an isolated manner. The purpose of this directive is to extend this practice to the whole (European) Community territory,&quot; it added. EU plans for mandatory checks were lent added urgency last February, when a Boeing 757 crashed into the sea after take-off from the Dominican Republic, killing all 189 people on board. The aircraft, which was leased to Dominican national airline Alas Nacionales by Turkish carrier Birgenair, was mainly carrying German tourists. The proposal, which requires agreement by EU governments and the European Parliament before it can come into force, should be finally agreed by December, the text said.
