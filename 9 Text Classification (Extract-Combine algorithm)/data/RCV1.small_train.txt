C13,C31,CCAT,E51,E512,ECAT	 The Transport Ministry rejected requests by the U.S. car parts industry on Wednesday for an easing of Japan's rules on brake systems. The U.S. industry asked last month for brakes to be removed from the ministry's list of parts that require servicing by a government-approved garage. The industry argued that the rule prevents market access by foreign manufacturers. The ministry said it rejected the request for safety reasons. &quot;It would make it possible for repairs to be carried out by people other than mechanics,&quot; the ministry said in a statement.   But the ministry said it had changed its certification system to allow the setting up of garages specialising in brakes, as requested by Washington in a 1995 bilateral auto agreement. A U.S. official said last week that Washington would be looking at both the decisions on brakes and garage systems in monitoring Japan's commitment to the 1995 accord. The United States has also requested that cars and car parts be included as part of the Japanese government's deregulation action plan due to be announced in March, the official told reporters in Tokyo. At the time, the official said he expected the ministry to accede to the requests but that the United States would assess its options if they were not met. Under the 1995 agreement, the U.S. car parts industry may lodge a protest with Japan's Transport Ministry against the decision.

M13,M132,MCAT	 The Australian dollar was holding at support after a sharp overnight fall, but the bias remains to the downside as the market waits on the release of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) quarterly assessment of the economy. The dollar dropped half a cent in offshore trade, and while good support has been found at around US$0.7380 this morning, the dollar has not had a substanital bounce and keeps testing the depth of support. At noon (0200 GMT), the dollar stood at US$0.7376/81, down on an early US$0.7381/86, and a Monday close of US$0.7423/28. It had traded a US$0.7373/86 range through the morning.   The market is waiting on the Reserve Bank of Australia's quarterly report on the economy later today, which will be combed for clues as to whether there will be a sixth rate cut. While a speech by RBA Governor Ian Macfarlane last week has largely pre-empted the report, attention will be paid in case of any extra details that help shape the interest rate outlook. Macfarlane said last week that there was excess capacity in the economy and that it could grow strongly -- possibly at more the 4.5 percent over the next couple of years -- without threatening the low inflation outlook.   For the Australian dollar, traders said the risk is that it will weaken on signs of an easing bias and so going into the release of the report the dollar is likely to remain cautious, as it has been in recent days ahead of the 9.30 a.m. announcement time for any RBA policy changes. Last week, the governor also said he did not see current monetary policy settings as restrictive, and a repetition of such a view, or a statement that the RBA was waiting to assess the impact of the five cuts already deliverd, could see the dollar squeeze higher.   Treasurer Peter Costello shares the RBA's upbeat view, telling reporters ahead of a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday that the economy could grow above four percent. &quot;I think if we can kill the savings problem and if we can beat inflation, we should be looking at an economy that grows at four percent plus,&quot; he said in Melbourne. While stronger growth is a positive for the dollar, the fact that rates may be lowered again in an effort to kick-start the growth remains a negative in the near term outlook. Once the RBA report is out of the way, the market will then look to the U.S., where the FOMC meets later today.   No rate change is expected from the FOMC when their meeting concludes on Wednesday morning local time, although the Federal Reserve is generally expected to raise interest rates at least one more time this year. On the crosses, the local dollar held steady as U.S. dollar trade was directionless in narrow ranges. The Australian dollar was trading at 87.18/28 yen and 1.3542/55 marks, from an early 87.17/27 and 1.3549/61 and local Monday closes of 87.11/21 and 1.3462/67. In trade weighted terms, the dollar was steady through the morning at 58.5, unchanged from its Monday close -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373 1800
C18,C181,CCAT	 Analysts warmly welcomed the confirmation on Tuesday that Amersham International Plc and Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Inc were to merge their life science operations. Alyson Coates of SocGen said although the structure of the merger, with Amersham holding 55 percent of the new company, reflected Amersham's greater profitability, the merger was good for both companies. &quot;This is not one side taking the lion's share,&quot; she said. Merrill Lynch analyst Nigel Barnes said the merger &quot;makes a great deal of strategic sense. The businesses are complementary and I'm sure the sum of the two parts will be significantly enhancing for the business as a whole.&quot; Coates welcomed a clear presentation of synergies between the two businesses, and a determination to bring Pharmacia Biotech's profitability up to the levels enjoyed at Amersham Life Science, which has profit margins of around 24 percent. &quot;Pharmacia will give Amersham more access to the biotech sector and there are also synergies in the customer base,&quot; she said. She said traditionally Pharmacia Biotech had been strong in separating biomolecules, while Amersham's skills lay in detecting and labelling them. Analysts said the split would allow Amersham's management to concentrate on its increasingly successful healthcare operation, which specialises in nuclear diagnostics and treatments for conditions such as cancers and strokes. Barnes said the merger had been structured so as to leave Amersham's options open, allowing it either to create completely separate life science and healthcare businesses or to eventually take total control of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech by buying out Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn. Coates added that &quot;in the long term I think we'll see this will signal Amersham's intention to position the two businesses independently.&quot; The detail of the agreement announced on Tuesday also reflected the fact that the two companies had been talking since the start of the year, analysts said. With a clear management structure in place, the merger business should avoid some of the pitfalls of international mergers, most notably suffered by Pharmacia Biotech's parent. &quot;It is very clear they have been talking for some time and I an confident that they will go forward and integrate quickly,&quot; Barnes said. --Jonathan Birt London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717

C18,C183,CCAT	 Nine Brazilian states mainly in the Northeast are in the process of privatizing their power utilities this year or early next year, said an official at Brazil's National Development Bank (BNDES). Rio de Janeiro and Bahia are the only states so far to have sold their power distributors, Cerj and Coelba, respectively. Coelba, which was privatized July 31, was seen as setting a new benchmark for future state power sell-offs as a result of the stunning price achieved during the auction of 1.73 billion reais, 77.38 percent above the minimum price. Next on the list of state power privatizations this year are CEEE (Rio Grande do Sul), CPFL (Sao Paulo), Cemat (Mato Grosso), Energipe (Sergipe) and Enersul (Mato Grosso do Sul), said Suely Monerat, head of BNDES' state privatizations department. Rio Grande do Sul state plans to sell off in October two power distributors to be spun off from CEEE, which is being split into six companies in all. CPFL is expected to be privatized at the end of October, beginning of November and Cemat, Energipe and Enersul should be sold off in November or December, Monerat said. Early next year power utilities of four northeastern states are due to go on the auction block, Cosern (Rio Grande do Norte), Celpa (Para), Cepisa (Piaui) and Ceal (Alagoas), she said. She said Rio Grande do Norte and Para states had already contracted consultants to advise on the sale of Cosern and Celpa, while consultants for the privatization of Cepisa and Ceal were still being chosen.

GCAT,GDIP,GVIO	 Uganda's foreign ministry said on Wednesday the government had agreed to the use of Entebbe airport as a base for international relief operations in the eastern Zaire crisis. &quot;We have previously said that they (the international community) can use Entebbe as a base for the relief efforts for the refugees in eastern Zaire and that has not changed,&quot; Ugandan foreign ministry spokesman Louis Balinda told Reuters. Canada, impatient with the indecision on the eastern Zaire refugee crisis, on Tuesday proposed that a military headquarters for relief operations be set up in Uganda. Uganda's Balinda said a United States relief advance team had already set up base at Entebbe &quot;and we see no problem with the Canadians joining their brothers there&quot;. Uganda borders Zaire, but does not have easy road links with the area the refugees are in. The U.N. Security Council mandated a Canadian-led military force for eastern Zaire on November 15, but the subsequent return of about 600,000 refugees into Rwanda and confusion over how many still remain has caused lengthy reassessment. &quot;Our view is that there needs to be some decisions soon on a course of action,&quot; Canadia Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said on Tuesday. &quot;So we'll be proposing to our partners -- and we hope we can get some closure in the next 24 hours -- that we go ahead with the establishment of a military headquarters operation in Entebbe to help coordinate matters and prepare for future actions, including reconnaissance flights into Zaire.&quot;

GCAT,GSPO	 Midfielder Ali Benarbia scored twice in less than four minutes as 10-man Monaco twice came from behind to draw 3-3 at Lyon on Sunday and stay seven points clear at the top of the French first division. After 55 minutes and with the score tied at 1-1, Monaco captain Franck Dumas received his second red card of the season when he committed his second bookable offence of the evening. Brazilian striker Anderson, scoring his 13th league goal of the season, put Monaco ahead in the eighth minute when he volleyed home a cross from midfielder Sylvain Legwinski. But mid-table Lyon equalised 10 minutes later through striker Franck Gava who headed home a cross from Christophe Cocard whose goal just after the hour initiated a 10-minute four-goal spree. Bernabia equalised in the 67th minute but, two minutes later, Ludovic Giuly put Lyon ahead again with his eighth goal of the season. Benarbia, however, ensured a share of the points when he levelled the score again in the 71st minute.

C12	 Antitrust charges against Archer Daniels Midland Co. and two executives are likely to be announced Sept. 24, even though negotiations between the company and the Justice Department on a possible plea agreement are continuing, a source close to the probe said Tuesday. Expected to be charged with fixing prices in the lysine market are Michael Andreas, vice chairman of ADM and son of Chairman Dwayne Andreas, and Terrance Wilson, a group vice president in charge of corn refining, the source said. The source said indictments are expected to be announced against &quot;Mick Andreas and Terry Wilson and ADM, if ADM doesn't have a plea. &quot;The company is still negotiating,&quot; the source said, adding that the charges are likely to be announced &quot;Tuesday of next week.&quot; Even if ADM reaches a plea agreement with the Justice Department, it will still face some charges, legal experts said. The plea agreement may include both specific charges brought against ADM and as well as prosecutors' recommendations for sentencing, one expert said. A separate plea agreement with Mark Whitacre, a former ADM executive who acted as a government informant in the antitrust investigation, is expected to be announced later, said the source, who spoke on condition he not be identified. Whitacre, who had headed ADM's BioProducts Division, was fired by ADM last year following allegations he stole millions of dollars from the company. Decatur, Ill.-based ADM, a giant corn and oilseed processor, did not return phone calls requesting comment. The Justice Department also declined to comment. Charges and possible plea agreements would settle at least part of an ongoing federal probe into alleged price-fixing in lysine, a feed additive, citric acid and high-fructose corn syrup. The source said the charges expected next week involve only lysine. Last month the Justice Department announced that three lysine producers entered pleas of no contest or guilty as part of the anti-trust probe. Ajinomoto Co. Inc. of Japan pleaded no contest, while Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. of Japan and Sewon Co. Ltd of South Korea admitted to conspiring to fix lysine prices. The three firms also agreed to cooperate in the investigation with documents and oral testimony, which legal experts said at the time increased the likelihood that ADM would face charges soon. The antitrust investigation came to light in June 1995 when ADM said it was subpoenaed for documents and testimony involving the lysine, citric acid and high-fructose corn syrup markets. ADM has denied any wrongdoing and has said it cooperated fully with the investigation.
GCAT,GSPO	 Arsenal scrapped to a hard-fought 2-0 win over nine-man Sunderland on Saturday to move into second place in the English premier league, level on points with leaders Liverpool who play West Ham on Sunday. Arsenal won with a John Hartson header after 73 minutes and a second from substitute Ray Parlour two minutes from time. But the real drama came in the first half when Sunderland manager Peter Reid was ordered from the dug-out as his side had two men sent off in 18 minutes by referee Paul Danson. Defender Martin Scott and striker Paul Stewart were both shown the red card for relatively minor offences. Scott was sent off after 21 minutes for a second foul on Arsenal defender Lee Dixon while Stewart was booked for a deliberate handball early in the match and was booked again and sent off after 39 minutes for appearing to handle the ball a second time. Reid had a shouting match with the referee after Scott's dismissal and was then banished from the dug-out. Wimbledon, who started the season with three straight league defeats, chalked up their fifth successive league win with a 2-0 victory at Derby with Robbie Earle (49th) and Marcus Gayle (70th) scoring. That moved Wimbledon up from sixth to third, level on points with Newcastle who play Aston Villa on Monday. The highest scorers of the day were Southampton, who beat Middlesbrough 4-0 for their first league win of the season. Matt Le Tissier scored twice with Matthew Oakley and Gordon Watson adding the others. Everton, who missed a sixth minute penalty when skipper David Unsworth fired against the bar, also bounced back to winning ways when they beat Sheffield Wednesday 2-0 thanks to goals from Andrei Kanchelskis (17th) and Graham Stuart (60th). It was their first win in nine games since the first day of the season. Wednesday, who won their opening four games to top the table, have now gone six league and cup games without a victory. Chelsea, beaten 5-1 by Liverpool last week and 3-1 by second division Blackpool in the league cup in midweek, almost bounced back to beat Nottingham Forest who made it 1-1 through Jason Lee in the last minute. Italian striker Gianluca Vialli had put Chelsea ahead after 51 minutes. In the other matches a 60th minute Emile Heskey goal gave Leicester a 1-0 win over Leeds, and lowly Coventry and Blackburn drew 0-0.
E12,ECAT,M13,M132,MCAT	 The Dutch central bank on Monday raised interest rates for the second time in less than two weeks in a bid to prop up the ailing guilder. But the move had little immediate effect on the currency's value against the German deutschemark, prompting talk of yet another tightening of monetary policy. It also barely moved the Dutch bond market, which had been weighed down by speculation of the rate hike. The bank raised the special advances rate to commercial banks, which sets the tone for money market rates, to 2.90 percent from 2.70 percent. It also lifted the secured loans rate, which sets the floor for money rates, to 2.50 percent from 2.00 percent. &quot;As usual, our monetary policy...is aimed at the maintenance of the guilder's track against the deutschemark,&quot; central bank spokesman Jan Paul Korthals told Reuters. This closed some of the interest rate gap between the Netherlands and Germany, its largest trading partner. The special advances rate is now just 10 basis points below its German equivalent, the repo rate, while the secured loans rate is now level with Germany's key discount rate. The special advances rate had been increased by 20 basis points on February 27 in a bid to stem the mark's rise against the guilder. The Netherlands tries to ensure the guilder trades in a narrow range against the German currency because of the trading ties between the two European neighbours. But despite the first hike, the mark had risen above 1.1260 guilders just before the rate move, from 1.1243 at the time of the first increase. MeesPierson economist Eric Nienhuis was not surprised by the second move. &quot;It was good to close this gap between the (German and Dutch) short term interest rates,&quot; he said. He also noted that the guilder/mark rate had barely reacted, easing just below 1.1260, but said he expected more of an impact eventually. Wike Groenenberg of Salomon Brothers told Reuters Financial Television there was no need for the central bank to raise rates again if the currency stabilised. &quot;If it weakens further then (it) will be very quick to increase interest rates and it may increase (them) to above German rates,&quot; she added. Martin Leen of ING saw the move as a first step to closing the interest rate gap with Germany completely. &quot;The Netherlands is experiencing higher economic growth and inflation as compared to Germany and it is logical that Dutch rates are brought back in line with German rates,&quot; he said. In the bond market, dealers detected little response to the widely expected tightening of monetary policy with the losses in the short end of the guilder curve occuring before, and in expectation of, the move. &quot;It was anticipated, so not too much happened,&quot; said one trader.
GCAT,GPOL	 President Bill Clinton was set to announce additional members of his new administration on Friday, with sources saying he was expected to keep his treasury secretary and attorney general. Clinton was to meet on Friday with a few additional members of his administration, including Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Environmental Protection Agency head Carol Browner -- and make announcements at a 2 p.m. EST 1900 GMT news conference. Clinton, who has been working on shaping the team that will serve him when he starts his second term in January, was intentionally vague about what decisions he intends to announce -- although much of his attention has been on the economic team he wants. He met privately on Thursday night in the Oval Office with Attorney General Janet Reno and told aides they had a &quot;wonderful meeting.&quot; Senior advisers said they expected Reno to remain in Clinton's Cabinet. Since Clinton won re-election on Nov. 5, seven Cabinet members have said that they plan to depart, including the commerce and labour secretaries. Two key economic advisers are also leaving: Laura Tyson, who heads the National Economic Council, and Joseph Stiglitz, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Administration officials said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and his deputy, Lawrence Summers, were expected to remain in their jobs. Administration officials consider both men strong and effective advocates for Clinton's economic policies. White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry, noting that Clinton has been considering several major posts in his new administration, sought to downplay speculation about specific announcements. &quot;There are a lot of things in play for tomorrow and I don't know what the outcome will be,&quot; McCurry said Thursday. A source familiar with the president's thinking said he would be &quot;very surprised&quot; if Reno did not remain in the Cabinet. &quot;If she wants to stay, I'm sure she can,&quot; another official said. Questions about Reno's job security have arisen because of her independent streak, which has often irked the White House. Some Clinton aides have also complained that she has been too quick to bow to partisan calls for independent counsel probes. Representative Bill Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat who has led a string of high-profile missions to rescue U.S. citizens detained abroad, has been under consideration to be commerce secretary. The Washington Post reported on Friday that William Daley, a prominent Democratic figure and brother of Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, was under consideration for the commerce post. Former Democratic Sen. Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania and White House aide Alexis Herman have been cited as candidates for labour secretary. Wofford was seen at the White House on Thursday. Clinton last week unveiled his foreign policy team as a group, and White House officials said at the time that he was likely to do so with his economic team, saying the &quot;chemistry&quot; among them was critical. With vacancies for chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers and for the post of head of the National Economic Council, administration officials have contacted Alan Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, about returning to the White House. Blinder, reportedly reluctant about returning to Washington, met on Thursday with the incoming White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles -- who also had been hesitant to return to the White House but bowed to Clinton's request. Blinder left his job at the Federal Reserve in January to return to teaching at Princeton University.
GCAT,GHEA,GSCI	 Combination treatment with aspirin and the hormone prednisone is not effective in helping women reduce the chance of miscarriages and may increase the risk of premature births, a study showed on Wednesday. The study, which will be published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, found the combination treatment did not increase the likelihood that women who have had repeated miscarriages will be able to carry an infant to term. The treatment, instead, may dramatically increase the risk of premature births, the study found. A team led by Dr. Carl A. Laskin of the University of Toronto based its results on 385 women who had at least two miscarriages and tested positive for a very sensitive immune system that may have been responsible for their spontaneous abortions. Of the 202 volunteers who became pregnant, half took the prednisone/aspirin combination and 66 had babies. The remainder, who were given a placebo, produced 57 babies, which was not a significant statistical difference. Yet when the researchers looked at the number of babies that were premature, they found a sharp difference between the two groups. More infants were born prematurely in the treatment group, 62 percent, than in the placebo group, 12 percent, researchers said. In addition, the likelihood that the mother would develop high blood pressure and diabetes was about three times higher among those taking the prednisone/aspirin combination. &quot;Prednisone and aspirin are not effective in preventing foetal loss&quot; in women whose immune systems carry self-destructive antibodies, the group concluded.

C11,C24,CCAT,GCAT,GWEA	 A dedicated &quot;snow desk&quot; has been set up by the New York and New Jersey Port Authority to monitor and react to harsh weather conditions and help prevent disruption to travellers and cargo moving through key airports this winter. The authority operates New York's John F Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark airports and carefully tracks weather patterns all year round. Each airport supplements National Weather Service reports with facility-specific forecasts from private companies that are updated a few times a day. &quot;We don't sit and wait for the weather to hit us&quot; said the Port authority chief operations officer David Feeley. &quot;We use the latest technology to anticipate what's coming day's in advance, which allows up to plan for deployment of employees and equipment at each facility.&quot; Each airport has a &quot;snow desk&quot; at which key operations and maintenance personnel analyse the weather reports and deploy staff and equipment accordingly. Each has inground sensors transmitting data such as windspeed and direction, dewpoint, humidity, air and ground temperatures. More than 5,100 tons of salt and sand, special de-icing equipment and 250 pieces of dedicated snow-fighting equipment - including massive snow-melters and snow blowers - is on standby to counter almost any winter blast at JFK, LaGuadria and Newark airports this year.

GCAT,GVIO	 Hardline Khmer Rouge guerrillas held government negotiators on Sunday after pretending they wanted to talk peace, senior officials said. &quot;Everything is going well, be we are still negotiating,&quot; said regional military commander General Khan Savoeun. His deputy, Nuon Vana, said 15 people were missing, including Siem Reap deputy governor Hem Bunheng, General Phuong Bunphoeun of the defence ministry, divisional commander Colonel Sochan Hang as well as air crew. They were on board an Mi-8 helicopter that left on Friday for a rendezvous with the rebels, after hardline leader Ta Mok said he wanted to talk about defecting, an officer at Siem Reap air base said. General Khan Savoeun and others on Sunday morning flew over the area of Anlong Remat located about 40 kms (25 miles) south of the hardliners' base at Anlong Veng in northern Cambodia, Nuon Vana said. He said they had been unable to contact the missing men or the Khmer Rouge, adding that radio links had been cut. &quot;Ta Mok played a trick because he said he wanted to join the government and made an appointment to meet...this is a bad trick, a terrible trick of Ta Mok,&quot; said the airbase officer in reference to the feared one-legged commander dubbed &quot;The Butcher.&quot; All those missing were from the royalist FUNCINPEC in Cambodias coalition government. FUNCINPEC and the rival Cambodian Peoples Party, which formed an uneasy coalition government after U.N.-run polls in 1993, have been vying for the allegiance of Khmer Rouge defectors. The Khmer Rouge, whose 1975-79 rule left more than one million people dead, reneged on a 1991 peace pact and had been fighting the coalition government since 1993. But the movement began falling apart after former top official Ieng Sary split with the hardliners in late August. Thousands of guerrillas have come over to the government side since Ieng Sary won a royal pardon last September from a 1979 death sentence handed down in absentia for his role in the Khmer Rouges &quot;killing fields&quot; rule. An estimated 2,000 hardliners loyal to Pol Pot and Ta Mok are holding out around Anlong Veng and the government has said it wants to win them over with words rather than guns. The government believes they may be holding Christopher Howes, a British mine clearance supervisor, who was abducted in Siem Reap province in March last year. He was reported to have escaped last November but never showed up in government territory.
E51,E512,ECAT	 Malaysia hopes for a trade surplus for the third straight month in October, Deputy Finance Minister Affifuddin Omar said on Wednesday. &quot;October (figures) will be coming soon. We hope it is possibly a surplus,&quot; he told reporters after opening a seminar on interest rate futures. &quot;Inshallah (by the grace of god),&quot; he said when asked to confirm if it would be a surplus in October. &quot;No, how can I commit myself,&quot; he said, when pressed further.   On Saturday, Malaysia announced a trade surplus of 668.4 million ringgit for September against a surplus of 604.5 million in August and a deficit of 280 million in September, 1995. Affifuddin said there could be some inflationary pressures arising towards the end of the year due to the release of nearly one billion ringgit into the market in the form of bonus payments to government employees. &quot;The government has already taken pre-emptive measures. Like the government has liberalised the importation of food, which has the biggest weightage on the CPI (Consumer Price Index),&quot; the minister said.   However, he declined to say if there would any change to the government's tight monetary policy stance next year as inflation is brought under control and the current account deficit drops. &quot;One of our major aims in 1997 is to manage the current account deficit as well as maintain a low inflation rate,&quot; Affifuddin said. &quot;Theoretically you have to tighten by decreasing money supply and by decreasing the velocity of the money. But, I am not saying that the government will be doing it,&quot; he said. -- Kuala Lumpur newsroom (603-230 8911)
C12,CCAT,GCAT,GCRIM	 Music Semiconductors Corp (MUSIC) said on Friday the Superior Court of New Jersey has upheld its rights over the assets of its unit Protelcon Inc, including patent rights over a television accessory called &quot;Telecommander&quot;.

M12,M13,M131,MCAT	 French bond futures remained rangebound during a nervous session as traders awaited the first opinion polls of voters' intentions for the upcoming May 25 parliamentary election. Traders said strong buying by a French brokerage at the open pushed the contract to the session high at 128.54 but it then drifted lower to test key support at 128.20/24. Traders said the fact the June contract survived numerous attempts to break lower prompted some to cover shorts late in the session, sparking a small rebound. The contract settled up 0.14 at 128.42   Traders said the two-year part of the French curve was in demand on Tuesday as the market stabilised following the official announcement late on Monday of the election. Traders said some domestics investors who sold two-year BTANs yesterday bought back the notes today. One trader said there was talk a French SICAV had bought between three and four billion francs of the benchmark April 1999 BTAN. Another said that some investors who had put on curve flattening trades recently, involving selling of two BTANs and buying five-year BTANs, were reversing their positions, again boosting demand for two-year BTANs.   June PIBOR, one of the contracts hardest hit by the political uncertainty last week, once again came in for a rocky ride, trading in a 14 basis point range. Traders said one of the main sellers during the past three sessions, a U.S. fund, cleared its position by buying back some 5,000 lots of short positions, in turn triggering stops at other brokerages and pushing the contract to its high of 96.42. The session was busy with 86,010 contracts changing hands. One trader said he thought it unlikely the contract would get much beyond 96.40 for now although he expected good support between 96.22 and 96.28.   Traders said speculation about sharp moves on the back of opinion polls kept the PIBOR options pit busy. The most active June option were the 96.50 calls with some 10,550 contracts traded. One British house bought 2,000 June puts at 95.00. Analysts said any sign the opposition Socialists were gaining ground would hit prices. Socialist leader Lionel Jospin has said he would not implement further tough fiscal policies to ensure France hits strict deficit targets for joining EMU. &quot;We'll be eating, drinking and sleeping polls over the next few weeks,&quot; a bond analyst at a French bank said.
C22	 International Business Machines Corp. Thursday unveiled its first network computer, a scaled-down personal computer for corporate networks, priced at under $700. IBM said the new computer, called the Network Station, is the first in a series of network devices it plans and will be out by the end of the year. It will put IBM among the first computer companies to offer an inexpensive device that will link people to the Internet as well as provide typical applications such as word processing and spreadsheets. The computer is eight by 10 inches by 1-1/4 inches and weighs 2.5 pounds. It has an IBM PowerPC microprocessor, varying amounts of memory, a network adaptor card, keyboard and mouse, with the monitor optional. The machine will be manufactured by IBM and Network Computing Devices of Mountain View, Calif. IBM's model is aimed at the business market, which is now building intranets -- networks that allow employees connected to a network to communicate with each other, receive e-mail and have access to the Internet. The Network Station will support network access via corporate intranets using Ethernet and Token Ring technology connections. The system can access Sun Microsystems' Java language, Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT software, UNIX, IBM's OS/2 operating system, and IBM's AS/400 minicomputers, RS/6000 workstations and System 390 mainframe computers.

E12,ECAT	 New Zealand monetary conditions have eased to the point where the Reserve Bank (RBNZ) may be forced to act, ANZ Bank said on Monday. In its weekly Market Focus report, ANZ said the market appeared to be testing the scope for easier monetary conditions in the lead-up to the RBNZ's June 27 Monetary Policy Statement (MPS), given general expectations that the bank will sanction some easing at that time.   &quot;Ninety-day bank bill rates have failed to rise sufficiently to offset a sharp fall in the New Zealand dollar's Trade-Weighted Index (TWI). As a result, monetary conditions are presently more than 90 basis points 'easier' in interest rate terms than the RBNZ's current desired conditions,&quot; ANZ said. &quot;Consequently, monetary conditions have eased to a point where we believe the RBNZ may be forced to act.&quot; ANZ said some people may believe that the bank was in &quot;radio silence&quot; at present given the proximity to the MPS release date. &quot;However, we feel the RBNZ may act if conditions remain as easy as they are at present.&quot;   ANZ said although it believed the bank would still sanction some easing in conditions in its MPS, inflation indicators to hand since March did not appear to warrant as significant an easing as the markets appeared to be anticipating. &quot;Any easing is likely to be limited -- around 50 basis points in interest rate terms from current desired monetary conditions,&quot; ANZ said. Meanwhile, ANZ said the RBNZ's announcement that it will alter aspects of its presentation in its upcoming MPS may give it greater direct influence on the shape of the yield curve.   The RBNZ will replace the current practice of assuming constant nominal rates and the TWI -- in its March projections the RBNZ assumed 90-day bills at 7.5 percent and the TWI at 68.0. Instead, the RBNZ now intends to provide a projected path for monetary conditions to achieve and maintain underlying inflation at 1.5 percent (the mid-point of its 0-3 percent target range) over the projected period.   ANZ said this meant the central bank would provide a quarterly indicative MCI (Monetary Conditions Index) track and probably also tracks for 90-day bank bills and the TWI consistent with this MCI path. &quot;This is really just a presentational change,&quot; ANZ said. &quot;Potentially, it introduces a little more transparency into the future path of monetary policy: the bank will be indicating how conditions will need to evolve over time if inflation is to remain comfortably within the target band.&quot;   In some instances this would provide greater guidance for the pricing of bank bill futures by taking some of the guesswork out of the future path of monetary conditions. &quot;Consequently, the bank may have a greater direct influence on the shape of the yield curve,&quot; ANZ said. --Wellington Newsroom (64 4) 4734746
C18,C181,C42,CCAT,E41,ECAT,GCAT,GJOB	 British Airways Plc was threatened with a strike by ground staff at its London Heathrow and Gatwick airports on Monday over plans to sell off its Heathrow catering production division. The Transport and General Work Union(T&amp;G) said that it is to ballot 9,000 ground staff members including baggage handlers, clerical and check-in workers as well as the catering staff. The T&amp;G said the result of the ballot will be announced on June 30, just as the summer travel season gets into full swing.   The airline deplored the move and vowed to keep services going if there was a strike. &quot;The T&amp;G announcement represents only an intention to ballot. There is no commitment from staff to strike and we hope that staff will reject this suggestion because there is absolutely no justification for it,&quot; said a company spokesman. &quot;We have contingency plans in place and come what may we will continue to fly,&quot; he said. BA put the long-haul catering business up for sale in April as part of its &quot;business efficiency&quot; campaign, aimed at finding a billion pounds of savings in annual costs from outsourcing and rationalisation. The T&amp;G accused BA management of wanting to create a &quot;virtual airline&quot; selling little more than a brand of service operated by outside contractors, something BA's chief executive Robert Ayling has denied. &quot;No British Airways employee will be safe from similar schemes if the catering sell-off goes ahead,&quot; George Ryde, the T&amp;G's national secretary for aviation, said in a statement. &quot;This is a highly productive and cost-effective operation and its sale only makes sense as part of a plan to turn BA into a 'virtual airline'.&quot; The T&amp;G also dimissed assurances BA has given that there would be no job losses among the 1,200 staff it employs, producing about 25,000 meals a day for its long-haul catering opearation. Its short-haul catering already employs outside contractors. BA said in announcing record profits last month that it had identified 600 million pounds of savings out of the one billion-pounds target. But the moves threaten a summer of discontent amongst its 58,000 employees, with 8,500 cabin crew represented by a unit of the T&amp;G already threatening strike action in a pay restructuring dispute. The result of that ballot is due to be announced on June 27, although a second cabin crew union, Cabin Crew 89, representing 3,500 mainly long-haul staff, have agreed &quot;exactly the same deal,&quot; said a company spokesman. 'Business Efficiency' initiatives announced so far include pay and job restructuring deals in baggage handling and the World Cargo division, rationalisation of some accounting functions, closure of its loss-making Contract Handling business serving third-party airline traffic at London Heathrow and outsourcing of ground vehicles services. &quot;We have already reached agreement with 30,000 staff and their union representatives across the business on our efficiency prgramme,&quot; said the company spokesman. &quot;Any strike (by the T&amp;G) would throw these agreements into jeopardy,&quot; he added. -- Greg Mahlich, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717

C13,C31,CCAT,E51,E512,ECAT	 Intense haggling over a statement on farm trade at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) ministerial meeting will probably not be settled until nearly the end of the conference, officials said on Thursday. The talks pit the European Union (EU), South Korea and Japan on one side and the United States and the Cairns Group of farm exporting countries, which range from Australia to Uruguay, on the other.   The dispute centres on proposed wording of the farm statement, which would mandate preliminary studies on farm issues to begin in 1997 to prepare for the start of formal negotiations on the issue in 1999. &quot;The U.S. and the Cairns Group want the preliminary talks to begin in 1997. Argentina wants to pin down the Europeans on this but the EU doesn't like it,&quot; an Asian agriculture minister said. A senior member of the U.S. delegation said: &quot;They're still haggling about it and this may take all night and take us close to the deadline tomorrow.'   He added: &quot;The Argentinians wanted stronger language in the agriculture declaration, but it will probably be toned down to keep the EU on board.&quot; There was no immediate comment available from EU officials. But a French government official told a meeting of farmers in France on Wednesday that Paris is strongly opposed to resuming negotiations in Singapore on the farm side of the 1994 GATT trade pact before the agreed 1999 deadline. But Australia, which heads the Cairns Group in the talks on the farm statement, insisted that the WTO's final declaration must include something on agriculture.   &quot;I would be bitterly disappointed if agriculture did not make it into the conference declaration,&quot; Australian Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer told a news conference on Thursday. Fischer said he was optimistic about progress on liberalising agricultural trade, one of the most contentious issues in the Uruguay Round of trade talks, which ended in 1994. The U.S. official said a farm statement should be available by the end of the conference on Friday but there would be more tough bargaining in the coming hours.   The Cairns Group and the United States want the WTO declaration to place emphasis on freeing up agricultural trade and endorsing a quicker removal of farm trade barriers. &quot;The EU doesn't want that kind of emphasis on farm trade,&quot; said an official of an Asian country which is a member of the Cairns Group. &quot;In fact, they don't want any mention of it whatsoever.&quot; Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton said there was a good chance of a separate statement being issued by the Cairns Group at the end of the conference but that it would not contradict the declaration.   &quot;We haven't finalised it yet but we're talking about it,&quot; he said.
C12,CCAT,GCAT,GCRIM	 Four states Thursday urged a federal judge to reject a proposed class-action settlement of consumer complaints against Prudential Insurance Co. of America, calling the deal unfair to consumers. Florida, Massachusetts, Texas and California said they filed objections to the settlement, which calls for Prudential to pay at least $410 million to as many as 10.7 million policyholders who say they were victims of deceptive sales practices. The states said the settlement offer was inadequate and placed too much of a burden on customers to prove that fraudulent misrepresentations were made when they purchased their policies. Prudential defended the settlement. &quot;We believe the settlement is fair and equitable to the policyholders, and 45 states agree with us,&quot; Prudential said. One of the lead attorneys who negotiated the settlement, Melvyn Weiss, also defended the deal, saying some of the states did not understand it. Policyholders had until Thursday to decide whether to remain members of the class action or battle Prudential on their own. As of last week, about 9,000 policyholders had declared they were opting out of the settlement. Weiss said he did not yet know how many have pulled out of the deal. But if a significant number of policyholders opt out, Prudential could face additional costly legal battles. The proposed settlement alone could cost Prudential as much as $1.2 billion in direct expenses and could have a total value to policyholders of almost $2 billion based on an expert opinion provided by accounting firm Arthur Andersen. Under the settlement, people who bought permanent life insurance from 1982 to 1995 are eligible for enhanced life insurance, annuities, and low-cost premium loans. Some may be eligible for other restitution, depending on how much damage they suffered. Opponents and supporters of the proposed settlement will have a chance to present their arguments at a hearing scheduled for Jan. 21 before U.S. District Judge Alfred Wolin in Newark, N.J. Meanwhile, Prudential has until Dec. 30 to respond to a formal administrative complaint filed by Florida Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson last week. Nelson's complaint alleges Prudential obstructed a state probe of the company's sales practices. He said Prudential could lose its license to operate in Florida if it did not provide requested documents. In addition to those complaints, the Massachusetts attorney general's office plans to review alleged destruction of documents at a Prudential office in Cambridge, Mass.. Prudential, which disclosed the document destruction Monday, called the action deplorable and said it had dismissed the Cambridge office's managing director. Wolin on Wednesday ordered an investigation into the incident and asked for a report by Dec. 27.

GCAT,GCRIM,GODD,GREL	 Investigators on Thursday began trying to identify the bodies of 39 cult members who apparently committed suicide in the belief a UFO, shielded behind a comet, would take them to heaven. Police said the men and women, dressed alike and with their hair in buzz cuts, appeared to have died from drug overdoses in a well-staged mass suicide over several days. &quot;We also were able to determine, based on their physical appearance and some of the characteristics of their bodies and liquid found at the scene, that they may have ingested drugs,&quot; Lt. Gerald Lipscomb of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department told CNN. Lipscomb said the suicides, discovered on Wednesday in a luxury mansion in Rancho Santa Fe, north of San Diego, may have taken place over seven days. He said all of the victims did not appear to have died at the same time. San Diego County Coroner's Office spokesman Chuck Bolton said the identification process would take several days. In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton said he was shocked and sickened by the deaths. &quot;It's heartbreaking, sickening ... shocking,&quot; Clinton said when asked his reaction to the deaths, which police described as the largest mass suicide in the United States in this century. He said he did not know any more about the incident than he had seen in media reports. The bodies were discovered by Beverly Hills computer expert Nick Matzorkis and one of his employees, a former member of the group. Matzorkis said the employee, identified only as Rio, received a packet from the group on Tuesday night saying its members had committed suicide. Matzorkis, owner of Interact Entertainment of Beverly Hills, told CNN the package also contained a video showing the members saying goodbye and that they appeared happy about their decision. In an interview on the NBC &quot;Today&quot; show, he said Rio told him he had received two videotapes and a letter from the cult. The two then drove to Rancho Santa Fe on Wednesday. &quot;He read me the letter in the car ... and they explained that by the time this letter was being read that they will have already, as they described it, 'shed their containers,' which is I guess what they use to describe their bodies,&quot; Matzorkis said. According to the letter and the videotape, he said, the cult members believed &quot;that they were going to be taken away by, as odd as this sounds, I'm just telling you what I heard, by a UFO, that a UFO would come by and pick them up.&quot; He said he had met about 15 members of the cult, which designed computer Internet web pages, and they told him the UFO was hiding behind the Hale-Bopp comet as it neared Earth. &quot;They explained to me that they believed that there was a UFO following behind that comet and using it as a shield so it could not be detected by Earth and that that UFO may very well be the one to take them away,&quot; Matzorkis said. When he and Rio arrived at the $1.6-million mansion on Wednesday, he said, Rio went into the house. &quot;When he first came out he was white as a sheet. He said 'They did it.'&quot; Matzorkis said he then contacted police in San Diego and asked them to check the house. He said the pre-suicide videotapes showed the victims &quot;were quite jovial and excited about moving on to this next stage.&quot; In Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno said the FBI would be ready to help state and local law enforcement agencies in the investigation. &quot;The FBI is working with state and local law enforcement in monitoring the situation,&quot; she told her weekly Justice Department news briefing. &quot;I don't know whether there has been a request for assistance but we stand ready to assist, and I understand the FBI is working with state and local law enforcement,&quot; she said. Cmdr. Alan Fulmer of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said the smell was so bad that police first feared the members may have died from poison gas, but they later determined the house smelled of death. &quot;There were no gas fumes in the house. The only smell coming out of that house was that of dead bodies,&quot; he said. Fulmer said he believed the 39, including an undetermined number of women, took their lives in a ritual that left them appearing as though they had died peacefully in their sleep. &quot;My supposition at this point is that it was a mass suicide.&quot; He said all the victims were cloaked in purple, triangular shrouds covering their faces and chests and wore black trousers and black tennis shoes. He said they were found lying on mattresses or cots with their hands at their sides as if they had fallen asleep. No suicide notes were found and there were no signs of physical trauma, adding to the mystery surrounding the deaths. Some 30 detectives and crime laboratory technicians from the sheriff's department were working on the case, Fulmer said, and experts from the Los Angeles Coroner's Office would be joining them later. Milton Silverman, a lawyer for the owner of the house, was quoted by local TV stations as saying it had been rented to a religious computer group led by a man called &quot;Father John&quot; and that its members, who did not drink alcohol or smoke and were celibate, believed they were sent to America as &quot;angels.&quot;
C33	 United Airlines has ordered $4.4 billion worth of airplanes from Boeing Co. and Europe's Airbus Industrie, with the the lion's share going to Boeing Co., the airline announced Thursday.   United ordered 27 jets -- 19 jumbo 747-400s, six 757s and two 777s -- valued at about $3.5 billion from Boeing and 24 Airbus A319s valued at $900 million. The UAL Corp. unit is the first U.S. airline to order Airbus's latest model, United and Airbus said. The order values quoted by United are based on manufacturers' list prices, the airline said. &quot;United benefited from substantial discounts to the prices from both manufacturers,&quot; it said.
C11,C24,C42,CCAT,E41,ECAT,GCAT,GJOB	 Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, facing tough competition and the impending handover of its Hong Kong home to China, is hitting even more turbulence from disgruntled pilots and mechanical problems on some aircraft. Hong Kong Aircrew Officers Association (HKAOA) members on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to work to rule, saying cost-cutting is threatening the blue chip company's reputation as a fair employer and safe carrier. &quot;Something must be done before our members reach breaking point,&quot; said the HKAOA, which said Cathay Pacific pilots would refuse to work on their guaranteed days off (G-days). The airline said the HKAOA was using the G-day issue against Cathay Pacific ahead of annual salary talks. HKAOA warned its action might cause cancellations of Cathay Pacific flights, but the airline denied this. Analysts say Cathay Pacific must cut costs in the teeth of tough international competition, not least from mainland China. Last year, China National Aviation Corp (CNAC) threatened to take Cathay Pacific on directly by setting up in Hong Kong and applying for an air operator's certificate. In a compromise deal, CNAC instead bought 36 percent of Hong Kong Dragon Airlines, mostly from Cathay Pacific and Swire Pacific Ltd Now as the handover of Hong Kong to China looms on July 1, China's CITIC Pacific Ltd controls 25 percent of the territory's carrier Cathay Pacific, and Chinese-owned CNAC has a slice of Dragonair, a successful and well-managed Hong Kong airline. A Chinese airline, Air China, is also threatening to grab a lucrative slice of Cathay Pacific's Hong Kong to London passenger flights. The inroads being made by new contenders are putting pressure on Cathay Pacific to prune costs, which some say is changing its corporate culture and increasing staff turnover. The HKAOA says seven senior pilots resigned in one month alone in 1996. However, cockpit costs are still high, with a pilot and first officer costing about HK$2.9 million a year in salary and benefits, according to one airline analyst. &quot;At the end of the day, these pilots are still the best paid in the world,&quot; he said. Cathay Pacific also played down problems in the Trent 700 engines built by Rolls-Royce Plc which have forced a series of unscheduled single-engine landings recently. It says a gearbox bearing is at fault, and all the gearbox bearings in its fleet of 11 Airbus A330-300 aircraft using the Trent 700 engine are being replaced. &quot;There is absolutely no question of danger to passengers,&quot; Swire Pacific finance director Peter Johansen told Reuters. The HKAOA says Swire, a 43.86 percent shareholder in Cathay Pacific, is partly to blame for problems at the airline. The HKAOA quoted unnamed analysts as speculating that Swire was looking to maximise the airline's profits and increase shareholder value ahead of selling out. &quot;This would create a more valuable exit from the airline, as they further reduce their shareholding,&quot; the HKAOA said. However Cathay Pacific spokesman Kwan Chuk-fai told Reuters, &quot;They (Swire) don't have any plans to change their shareholding.&quot; -- Hong Kong newsroom (852) 2843 6321

C18,C183,CCAT,E12,ECAT	 International investment house Nomura has said it wants to help the Baltic state of Lithuania privatise its state-owned telecommunications firm Lietuvos Telekomas, the communications minister said on Friday.

C13,C18,C181,CCAT	 Opposition New Zealand First Party leader Winston Peters said on Tuesday that raising the stake foreigners can hold in Air New Zealand Ltd was an &quot;act of deception&quot; by the government. The government said on Monday it had agreed to raise the proportion of Air NZ &quot;B&quot; shares, the only ones which foreigners can buy, to 49 percent from 35 percent. Foreign airlines would be allowed to hold up to 35 percent of Air NZ in total, with a 25 percent limit for any one foreign carrier.   Peters, whose party says it aims to defend New Zealand's economic sovereignty, said raising the limit was an act of deception so close to a general election. New Zealand goes to the polls on October 12. &quot;If they're prepared to go to 49 percent before the election, how (much) further will they go after it?&quot; he told Radio New Zealand. He said Air New Zealand could no longer be seen as a national carrier.   Doug Kidd, minister responsible for the government's &quot;kiwi share&quot; in Air NZ, said the change was to bring New Zealand's investment regime into line with Australia's for the purpose of the planned single aviation market between the two countries. The move coincided with Air New Zealand's announcement of terms for its planned purchase of half of Australia's Ansett Holdings from TNT Ltd for a total A$475 million. -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 473-4746
C13,C18,C181,CCAT	 Suffolk County, New York, legislators expect to decide on Thursday whether to hire a law firm and a team of consultants to probe a partial takeover of Long Island Lighting Co, a spokesman said. The county legislators already have authorized spending up to $200,000 to hire such firms. &quot;Several members of the legislature are concerned, though they are not prejudging, and they want to get all the facts and information,&quot; said Warren Greene, a spokesman for the lawmakers.   Gov George Pataki has proposed what would be the nation's biggest tax-exempt bond sale -- $7.3 billion -- to buy assets from LILCO and Brooklyn Union Gas, which plan to merge. The bonds would be sold by the Long Island Power Authority, which the state created in 1986 to acquire LILCO. The Republican govenor on Wednesday night planned to hold a news conference in the Village of Northport in the Town of Huntington, which is located in Suffolk County. Greene said that before a town meeting, scheduled to follow the news conference, the governor was expected to meet with the county legislators.   Republicans hold an 11 to 7 majority in the body, and the County Executive, Robert Gaffney, opposes its plans. &quot;There's finally meaningful, tangible relief on the horizon and now the legislature is thinking of delaying it even further so the county executive is deadset against it,&quot; said Tim Ryan, a spokesman for Gaffney. A spokesman for the governor said he expected the news conference to focus on Pataki's proposal, which he has said would cut by 20 percent rates for Long Islanders, who now pay some of the highest in the United States. No new information was expected to be released, added the spokesman, Mike McKeon.   The Democrat-led Assembly, which has been holding hearings on the deal, plans to hold at least two more, one on May 14 and one on June 5. LILCO chairman William Catacosinos is expected to testify at the May 14 hearing in Albany, but LILCO could not immediately say whether he will go. Assemblyman Paul Tonko, an Amsterdam Democrat who chairs the committee on energy, said the process was open-ended. &quot;We may need to do some more (hearings), then we have to compile what we have heard, then there will be ongoing discussions,&quot; he said.   Among the issues he raised was whether the deal would enrich LILCO shareholders. &quot;The ratepayer is asked to hold the LILCO structure harmless and to actually put more hard cash into the hands of the leadership and the executive of LILCO,&quot; he said. He also cited concerns about whether the huge bond issue, which would be offered in a series of sales, would drive up how much the state was forced to pay in interest on its own debt, and whether LILCO would get preferential treatment over its competitors.   &quot;When you're talking about a 33-year deal, you don't want to lock a Long Island ratepayer into a situation that is going to hinder them more than help them.&quot; Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, D-Manhattan, could block the deal as he serves on the Public Authorities Control Board, which approves and coordinates bond sales by state authorities. Rumors that the board might take up the LILCO deal at a meeting next week could not be immediately confirmed. The energy and enivronment committee of the Suffolk County legislature recommended that the body select Scott Hempling, a Silver Springs, Maryland, law firm, which specializes in utility matters, and Boston-based consultants, LaCapra Associates, which has broad experience in the area.

M13,M132,MCAT	 The New Zealand dollar closed higher on Thursday, rebounding from recent weakness on strong Asian and local corporate buying. The Kiwi finished at US$0.6927/34 and 68.17 on its Trade-Weighted Index, from 0.6890/00 and 68.00 at the opening. &quot;A very solid performance in the Kiwi on balance today. The U.S. dollar's weakness has contributed to it, and the strength we've seen in the Aussie in the last 24 hours. The fact that we haven't seen any major U.S. fund selling overnight in the Kiwi was a big positive today,&quot; a bank chief dealer said.   He said some supply had come back in around 0.6925 but the market was evenly balanced, with quite a few people sitting short Kiwi. While progess would probably be limited in the next 24 hours, he did not rule out a move towards 0.6950-70. The currency traded as high as 0.6938 during the session, where it ran into profit-taking, and another trader said the market had felt short all day. He said any dips overnight would be limited, and the currency may take a look at 0.6950, but there was some wariness about the possibility of more U.S. selling.   -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746

C17,C171,CCAT	 The initial public share offer of leading Kenyan hotel concern Serena Lodges &amp; Hotels was four times oversubscribed, the group's financial advisers said on Tuesday. Barclays Merchant Finance Ltd said a of 38.7 million shares were applied for compared to 9,025,100 shares on offer. The offer was at a price of 13 shillings ($0.24) per share. &quot;This is one of the largest such oversubscriptions in recent years and suggests considerable investor confidence in TPS and its future in what is an increasingly competitive tourism industry in Kenya,&quot; an official at Barclays said. The 9,025,100 shares on offer, or 23.3 percent of total shareholding, were held by government tourism agency Kenya Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC) in TPS (Tourism Promotion Services), which is majority owned by the Aga Khan. There were 15,800 applicants for the share out of which 7,782 applied for less than 600 shares while 8,018, including 738 institutional investors, applied for more than 600 shares. Barclays would not say what percentage of the subscription was by foreign investors. It said those who applied for up to 600 shares would receive the minimum 500 shares each while applicants above 600 shares would receive 640 shares each. Barclays said institutional investors would also be confined to 640 shares each. &quot;Clearly, the figures show the share has become a retail share and it's going to be very interesting to watch how it will perform in the secondary market,&quot; a senior broker said. The Serena group has projected an increased turnover of 1.27 billion shillings ($23.96 million) and an after-tax profit of 66.3 million for the year ending 31 December 1997, compared to a turnover of 1.16 billion shillings and an after-tax profit of 41.2 million shillings for the year ending 31 December 1996. Serena Lodges &amp; Hotels operates two luxury hotels in the capital Nairobi and the resort of Mombasa and three lodges in the game reserves of Masai Mara, Amboseli and Samburu. Barclays said it would refund cash for unsuccessful applications by 30th April. The heavy oversubscription surprised brokers who had seen the share as being undermined by scepticism over Kenya's future as a preferred tourist destination. The Central Bank of Kenya's economic review for March showed a drop of seven percent in tourism earnings to $447 million in the year to January 1997 from $482 million the previous year. The success in the flotation on the Nairobi Stock Exchange of Serena follows that of Kenya Airways, National Bank of Kenya and Kenya Commercial Bank in 1996.
